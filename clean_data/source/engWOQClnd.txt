In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Now the earth was formless and empty darkness was over the surface of the deep and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
And God said Let there be light and there was light.
God saw that the light was good and he separated the light from the darkness.
God called the light day and the darkness he called night. And there was evening and there was morningthe first day.
And God said Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.
So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.
God called the expanse sky. And there was evening and there was morningthe second day.
And God said Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place and let dry ground appear. And it was so.
God called the dry ground land and the gathered waters he called seas. And God saw that it was good.
Then God said Let the land produce vegetation seedbearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it according to their various kinds. And it was so.
The land produced vegetation plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
And there was evening and there was morningthe third day.
And God said Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years
and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth. And it was so.
God made two great lightsthe greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth
to govern the day and the night and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
And there was evening and there was morningthe fourth day.
And God said Let the water teem with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.
So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems according to their kinds and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
God blessed them and said Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas and let the birds increase on the earth.
And there was evening and there was morningthe fifth day.
And God said Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds livestock creatures that move along the ground and wild animals each according to its kind. And it was so.
God made the wild animals according to their kinds the livestock according to their kinds and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
Then God said Let us make man in our image in our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air over the livestock over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground.
So God created man in his own image in the image of God he created him male and female he created them.
God blessed them and said to them Be fruitful and increase in number fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.
Then God said I give you every seedbearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the groundeverything that has the breath of life in itI give every green plant for food. And it was so.
God saw all that he had made and it was very good. And there was evening and there was morningthe sixth day.
Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens
and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground
but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground
the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being.
Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east in Eden and there he put the man he had formed.
And the Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the groundtrees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
A river watering the garden flowed from Eden from there it was separated into four headwaters.
The name of the first is the Pishon it winds through the entire land of Havilah where there is gold.

The name of the second river is the Gihon it winds through the entire land of Cush.
The name of the third river is the Tigris it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
And the Lord God commanded the man You are free to eat from any tree in the garden
but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for when you eat of it you will surely die.
The Lord God said It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.
Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them and whatever the man called each living creature that was its name.
So the man gave names to all the livestock the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep and while he was sleeping he took one of the mans ribs and closed up the place with flesh.
Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man and he brought her to the man.
The man said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man.
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and they will become one flesh.
The man and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame.
Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman Did God really say You must not eat from any tree in the garden?
The woman said to the serpent We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden
but God did say You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden and you must not touch it or you will die. 
You will not surely die the serpent said to the woman.
For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good and evil.
When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it.
Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they realized they were naked so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
But the Lord God called to the man Where are you?
He answered I heard you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked so I hid.
And he said Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?
The man said The woman you put here with meshe gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it.
Then the Lord God said to the woman What is this you have done? The woman said The serpent deceived me and I ate.
So the Lord God said to the serpent Because you have done this Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers he will crush your head and you will strike his heel.
To the woman he said I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you.
To Adam he said Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you You must not eat of it Cursed is the ground because of you through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
It will produce thorns and thistles for you and you will eat the plants of the field.
By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return.
Adam named his wife Eve because she would become the mother of all the living.
The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
And the Lord God said The man has now become like one of us knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever.
So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
After he drove the man out he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
Adam lay with his wife Eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.
Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks and Cain worked the soil.
In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.
But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering
but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry and his face was downcast.
Then the Lord said to Cain Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?
If you do what is right will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right sin is crouching at your door it desires to have you but you must master it.
Now Cain said to his brother Abel Lets go out to the field. And while they were in the field Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
Then the Lord said to Cain Where is your brother Abel? I dont know he replied. Am I my brothers keeper?
The Lord said What have you done? Listen! Your brothers blood cries out to me from the ground.
Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand.
When you work the ground it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.
Cain said to the Lord My punishment is more than I can bear.
Today you are driving me from the land and I will be hidden from your presence I will be a restless wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me.
But the Lord said to him Not so if anyone kills Cain he will suffer vengeance seven times over. Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
So Cain went out from the Lords presence and lived in the land of Nod east of Eden.
Cain lay with his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city and he named it after his son Enoch.
To Enoch was born Irad and Irad was the father of Mehujael and Mehujael was the father of Methushael and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
Lamech married two women one named Adah and the other Zillah.
Adah gave birth to Jabal he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
His brothers name was Jubal he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
Zillah also had a son TubalCain who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. TubalCains sister was Naamah.
Lamech said to his wives Adah and Zillah listen to me wives of Lamech hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me a young man for injuring me.
If Cain is avenged seven times then Lamech seventyseven times.
Adam lay with his wife again and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth saying God has granted me another child in place of Abel since Cain killed him.
Seth also had a son and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of the Lord.
This is the written account of Adams line. When God created man he made him in the likeness of God.
He created them male and female and blessed them. And when they were created he called them man.
When Adam had lived 130 years he had a son in his own likeness in his own image and he named him Seth.
After Seth was born Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Adam lived 930 years and then he died.
When Seth had lived 105 years he became the father of Enosh.
And after he became the father of Enosh Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Seth lived 912 years and then he died.
When Enosh had lived 90 years he became the father of Kenan.
And after he became the father of Kenan Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Enosh lived 905 years and then he died.
When Kenan had lived 70 years he became the father of Mahalalel.
And after he became the father of Mahalalel Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Kenan lived 910 years and then he died.
When Mahalalel had lived 65 years he became the father of Jared.
And after he became the father of Jared Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Mahalalel lived 895 years and then he died.
When Jared had lived 162 years he became the father of Enoch.
And after he became the father of Enoch Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Jared lived 962 years and then he died.
When Enoch had lived 65 years he became the father of Methuselah.
And after he became the father of Methuselah Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Enoch lived 365 years.
Enoch walked with God then he was no more because God took him away.
When Methuselah had lived 187 years he became the father of Lamech.
And after he became the father of Lamech Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Methuselah lived 969 years and then he died.
When Lamech had lived 182 years he had a son.
He named him Noah and said He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.
After Noah was born Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
Altogether Lamech lived 777 years and then he died.
After Noah was 500 years old he became the father of Shem Ham and Japheth.
When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them
the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they married any of them they chose.
Then the Lord said My Spirit will not contend with man forever for he is mortal his days will be a hundred and twenty years.
The Nephilim were on the earth in those daysand also afterwardwhen the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old men of renown.
The Lord saw how great mans wickedness on the earth had become and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.
The Lord was grieved that he had made man on the earth and his heart was filled with pain.
So the Lord said I will wipe mankind whom I have created from the face of the earthmen and animals and creatures that move along the ground and birds of the airfor I am grieved that I have made them.
But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man blameless among the people of his time and he walked with God.
Noah had three sons Shem Ham and Japheth.
Now the earth was corrupt in Gods sight and was full of violence.
God saw how corrupt the earth had become for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
So God said to Noah I am going to put an end to all people for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
So make yourself an ark of cypress wood make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
This is how you are to build it The ark is to be 450 feet long 75 feet wide and 45 feet high.
Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower middle and upper decks.
I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.
But I will establish my covenant with you and you will enter the arkyou and your sons and your wife and your sons wives with you.
You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures male and female to keep them alive with you.
Two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.
You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.
Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
The Lord then said to Noah Go into the ark you and your whole family because I have found you righteous in this generation.
Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal a male and its mate and two of every kind of unclean animal a male and its mate
and also seven of every kind of bird male and female to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.
Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made.
And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him.
Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
Pairs of clean and unclean animals of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground
male and female came to Noah and entered the ark as God had commanded Noah.
And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noahs life on the seventeenth day of the second monthon that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
On that very day Noah and his sons Shem Ham and Japheth together with his wife and the wives of his three sons entered the ark.
They had with them every wild animal according to its kind all livestock according to their kinds every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind everything with wings.
Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
The animals going in were male and female of every living thing as God had commanded Noah. Then the Lord shut him in.
For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.
The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
They rose greatly on the earth and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.
The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet.
Every living thing that moved on the earth perishedbirds livestock wild animals all the creatures that swarm over the earth and all mankind.
Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left and those with him in the ark.
The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark and he sent a wind over the earth and the waters receded.
Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.
The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down
and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
The waters continued to recede until the tenth month and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark
and sent out a raven and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.
Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.
But the dove could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.
He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
When the dove returned to him in the evening there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.
He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again but this time it did not return to him.
By the first day of the first month of Noahs six hundred and first year the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
By the twentyseventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
Then God said to Noah
Come out of the ark you and your wife and your sons and their wives.
Bring out every kind of living creature that is with youthe birds the animals and all the creatures that move along the groundso they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it.
So Noah came out together with his sons and his wife and his sons wives.
All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birdseverything that moves on the earthcame out of the ark one kind after another.
Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.
The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart Never again will I curse the ground because of man even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.
As long as the earth endures seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night will never cease.
Then God blessed Noah and his sons saying to them Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.
The fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air upon every creature that moves along the ground and upon all the fish of the sea they are given into your hands.
Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants I now give you everything.
But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.
And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each man too I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man.
Whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God has God made man.
As for you be fruitful and increase in number multiply on the earth and increase upon it.
Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him
I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you
and with every living creature that was with youthe birds the livestock and all the wild animals all those that came out of the ark with youevery living creature on earth.
I establish my covenant with you Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.
And God said This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you a covenant for all generations to come
I have set my rainbow in the clouds and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds
I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.
So God said to Noah This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.
The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem Ham and Japheth.
These were the three sons of Noah and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth.
Noah a man of the soil proceeded to plant a vineyard.
When he drank some of its wine he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.
Ham the father of Canaan saw his fathers nakedness and told his two brothers outside.
But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders then they walked in backward and covered their fathers nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their fathers nakedness.
When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him
he said Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.
He also said Blessed be the Lord the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
May God extend the territory of Japheth may Japheth live in the tents of Shem and may Canaan be his slave.
After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
Altogether Noah lived 950 years and then he died.
This is the account of Shem Ham and Japheth Noahs sons who themselves had sons after the flood.
The sons of Japheth Gomer Magog Madai Javan Tubal Meshech and Tiras.
The sons of Gomer Ashkenaz Riphath and Togarmah.
The sons of Javan Elishah Tarshish the Kittim and the Rodanim.

The sons of Ham Cush Mizraim Put and Canaan.
The sons of Cush Seba Havilah Sabtah Raamah and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah Sheba and Dedan.
Cush was the father of Nimrod who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord that is why it is said Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the Lord.
The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon Erech Akkad and Calneh in Shinar.
From that land he went to Assyria where he built Nineveh Rehoboth Ir Calah
and Resen which is between Nineveh and Calah that is the great city.
Mizraim was the father of the Ludites Anamites Lehabites Naphtuhites
Pathrusites Casluhites  and Caphtorites.
Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn and of the Hittites
Jebusites Amorites Girgashites
Hivites Arkites Sinites
Arvadites Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered
and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza and then toward Sodom Gomorrah Admah and Zeboiim as far as Lasha.
These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages in their territories and nations.
Sons were also born to Shem whose older brother was Japheth Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
The sons of Shem Elam Asshur Arphaxad Lud and Aram.
The sons of Aram Uz Hul Gether and Meshech.
Arphaxad was the father of Shelah and Shelah the father of Eber.
Two sons were born to Eber One was named Peleg because in his time the earth was divided his brother was named Joktan.
Joktan was the father of Almodad Sheleph Hazarmaveth Jerah
Hadoram Uzal Diklah
Obal Abimael Sheba
Ophir Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar in the eastern hill country.
These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages in their territories and nations.
These are the clans of Noahs sons according to their lines of descent within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.
As men moved eastward they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
They said to each other Come lets make bricks and bake them thoroughly. They used brick instead of stone and tar for mortar.
Then they said Come let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.
But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building.
The Lord said If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
Come let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.
So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth and they stopped building the city.
That is why it was called Babel because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
This is the account of Shem. Two years after the flood when Shem was 100 years old he became the father of Arphaxad.
And after he became the father of Arphaxad Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
When Arphaxad had lived 35 years he became the father of Shelah.
And after he became the father of Shelah Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
When Shelah had lived 30 years he became the father of Eber.
And after he became the father of Eber Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
When Eber had lived 34 years he became the father of Peleg.
And after he became the father of Peleg Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
When Peleg had lived 30 years he became the father of Reu.
And after he became the father of Reu Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
When Reu had lived 32 years he became the father of Serug.
And after he became the father of Serug Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
When Serug had lived 30 years he became the father of Nahor.
And after he became the father of Nahor Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
When Nahor had lived 29 years he became the father of Terah.
And after he became the father of Terah Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
After Terah had lived 70 years he became the father of Abram Nahor and Haran.
This is the account of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
While his father Terah was still alive Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans in the land of his birth.
Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abrams wife was Sarai and the name of Nahors wife was Milcah she was the daughter of Haran the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
Now Sarai was barren she had no children.
Terah took his son Abram his grandson Lot son of Haran and his daughterinlaw Sarai the wife of his son Abram and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran they settled there.
Terah lived 205 years and he died in Haran.
The Lord had said to Abram Leave your country your people and your fathers household and go to the land I will show you.
I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you I will make your name great and you will be a blessing.
I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you I will curse and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.
So Abram left as the Lord had told him and Lot went with him. Abram was seventyfive years old when he set out from Haran.
He took his wife Sarai his nephew Lot all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran and they set out for the land of Canaan and they arrived there.
Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
The Lord appeared to Abram and said To your offspring I will give this land. So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him.
From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord.
Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.
Now there was a famine in the land and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.
As he was about to enter Egypt he said to his wife Sarai I know what a beautiful woman you are.
When the Egyptians see you they will say This is his wife. Then they will kill me but will let you live.
Say you are my sister so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.
When Abram came to Egypt the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman.
And when Pharaohs officials saw her they praised her to Pharaoh and she was taken into his palace.
He treated Abram well for her sake and Abram acquired sheep and cattle male and female donkeys menservants and maidservants and camels.
But the Lord inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abrams wife Sarai.
So Pharaoh summoned Abram. What have you done to me? he said. Why didnt you tell me she was your wife?
Why did you say She is my sister so that I took her to be my wife? Now then here is your wife. Take her and go!
Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men and they sent him on his way with his wife and everything he had.
So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev with his wife and everything he had and Lot went with him.
Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.
From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier
and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the Lord.
Now Lot who was moving about with Abram also had flocks and herds and tents.
But the land could not support them while they stayed together for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.
And quarreling arose between Abrams herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
So Abram said to Lot Lets not have any quarreling between you and me or between your herdsmen and mine for we are brothers.
Is not the whole land before you? Lets part company. If you go to the left Ill go to the right if you go to the right Ill go to the left.
Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered like the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt toward Zoar.
So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company
Abram lived in the land of Canaan while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the Lord.
The Lord said to Abram after Lot had parted from him Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south east and west.
All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.
I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth so that if anyone could count the dust then your offspring could be counted.
Go walk through the length and breadth of the land for I am giving it to you.
So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron where he built an altar to the Lord.
At this time Amraphel king of Shinar Arioch king of Ellasar Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim
went to war against Bera king of Sodom Birsha king of Gomorrah Shinab king of Admah Shemeber king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela .
All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim .
For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
In the fourteenth year Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim the Zuzites in Ham the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim
and the Horites in the hill country of Seir as far as El Paran near the desert.
Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat  and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon Tamar.
Then the king of Sodom the king of Gomorrah the king of Admah the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela  marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim
against Kedorlaomer king of Elam Tidal king of Goiim Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasarfour kings against five.
Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.
The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food then they went away.
They also carried off Abrams nephew Lot and his possessions since he was living in Sodom.
One who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite a brother of Eshcol and Aner all of whom were allied with Abram.
When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them pursuing them as far as Hobah north of Damascus.
He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions together with the women and the other people.
After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh .
Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High
and he blessed Abram saying Blessed be Abram by God Most High Creator of heaven and earth.
And blessed be God Most High who delivered your enemies into your hand. Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
The king of Sodom said to Abram Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.
But Abram said to the king of Sodom I have raised my hand to the Lord God Most High Creator of heaven and earth and have taken an oath
that I will accept nothing belonging to you not even a thread or the thong of a sandal so that you will never be able to say I made Abram rich.
I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with meto Aner Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their share.
After this the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision Do not be afraid Abram. I am your shield your very great reward.
But Abram said O Sovereign Lord what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?
And Abram said You have given me no children so a servant in my household will be my heir.
Then the word of the Lord came to him This man will not be your heir but a son coming from your own body will be your heir.
He took him outside and said Look up at the heavens and count the starsif indeed you can count them. Then he said to him So shall your offspring be.
Abram believed the Lord and he credited it to him as righteousness.
He also said to him I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.
But Abram said O Sovereign Lord how can I know that I will gain possession of it?
So the Lord said to him Bring me a heifer a goat and a ram each three years old along with a dove and a young pigeon.
Abram brought all these to him cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other the birds however he did not cut in half.
Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses but Abram drove them away.
As the sun was setting Abram fell into a deep sleep and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.
Then the Lord said to him Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves and afterward they will come out with great possessions.
You however will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.
In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.
When the sun had set and darkness had fallen a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.
On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said To your descendants I give this land from the river of Egypt to the great river the Euphrates
the land of the Kenites Kenizzites Kadmonites
Hittites Perizzites Rephaites
Amorites Canaanites Girgashites and Jebusites.
Now Sarai Abrams wife had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar
so she said to Abram The Lord has kept me from having children. Go sleep with my maidservant perhaps I can build a family through her. Abram agreed to what Sarai said.
So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.
He slept with Hagar and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant she began to despise her mistress.
Then Sarai said to Abram You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms and now that she knows she is pregnant she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.
Your servant is in your hands Abram said. Do with her whatever you think best. Then Sarai mistreated Hagar so she fled from her.
The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.
And he said Hagar servant of Sarai where have you come from and where are you going? Im running away from my mistress Sarai she answered.
Then the angel of the Lord told her Go back to your mistress and submit to her.
The angel added I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.
The angel of the Lord also said to her You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael for the Lord has heard of your misery.
He will be a wild donkey of a man his hand will be against everyone and everyones hand against him and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.
She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her You are the God who sees me for she said I have now seen the One who sees me.
That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi it is still there between Kadesh and Bered.
So Hagar bore Abram a son and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
Abram was eightysix years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
When Abram was ninetynine years old the Lord appeared to him and said I am God Almighty walk before me and be blameless.
I will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.
Abram fell facedown and God said to him
As for me this is my covenant with you You will be the father of many nations.
No longer will you be called Abram your name will be Abraham for I have made you a father of many nations.
I will make you very fruitful I will make nations of you and kings will come from you.
I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
The whole land of Canaan where you are now an alien I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you and I will be their God.
Then God said to Abraham As for you you must keep my covenant you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.
This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you the covenant you are to keep Every male among you shall be circumcised.
You are to undergo circumcision and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreignerthose who are not your offspring.
Whether born in your household or bought with your money they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.
Any uncircumcised male who has not been circumcised in the flesh will be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant.
God also said to Abraham As for Sarai your wife you are no longer to call her Sarai her name will be Sarah.
I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations kings of peoples will come from her.
Abraham fell facedown he laughed and said to himself Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?
And Abraham said to God If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!
Then God said Yes but your wife Sarah will bear you a son and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
And as for Ishmael I have heard you I will surely bless him I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers and I will make him into a great nation.
But my covenant I will establish with Isaac whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.
When he had finished speaking with Abraham God went up from him.
On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money every male in his household and circumcised them as God told him.
Abraham was ninetynine years old when he was circumcised
and his son Ishmael was thirteen
Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that same day.
And every male in Abrahams household including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner was circumcised with him.
The Lord appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.
Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
He said If I have found favor in your eyes my lord do not pass your servant by.
Let a little water be brought and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.
Let me get you something to eat so you can be refreshed and then go on your waynow that you have come to your servant. Very well they answered do as you say.
So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. Quick he said get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread.
Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice tender calf and gave it to a servant who hurried to prepare it.
He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared and set these before them. While they ate he stood near them under a tree.
Where is your wife Sarah? they asked him. There in the tent he said.
Then the Lord said I will surely return to you about this time next year and Sarah your wife will have a son. Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent which was behind him.
Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought After I am worn out and my master is old will I now have this pleasure?
Then the Lord said to Abraham Why did Sarah laugh and say Will I really have a child now that I am old?
Is anything too hard for the Lord? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.
Sarah was afraid so she lied and said I did not laugh. But he said Yes you did laugh.
When the men got up to leave they looked down toward Sodom and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.
Then the Lord said Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
For I have chosen him so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.
Then the Lord said The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous
that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not I will know.
The men turned away and went toward Sodom but Abraham remained standing before the Lord.
Then Abraham approached him and said Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
Far be it from you to do such a thingto kill the righteous with the wicked treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?
The Lord said If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom I will spare the whole place for their sake.
Then Abraham spoke up again Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord though I am nothing but dust and ashes
what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city because of five people? If I find fortyfive there he said I will not destroy it.
Once again he spoke to him What if only forty are found there? He said For the sake of forty I will not do it.
Then he said May the Lord not be angry but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there? He answered I will not do it if I find thirty there.
Abraham said Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord what if only twenty can be found there? He said For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.
Then he said May the Lord not be angry but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there? He answered For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.
When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham he left and Abraham returned home.
The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
My lords he said please turn aside to your servants house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning. No they answered we will spend the night in the square.
But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them baking bread without yeast and they ate.
Before they had gone to bed all the men from every part of the city of Sodomboth young and oldsurrounded the house.
They called to Lot Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.
Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him
and said No my friends. Dont do this wicked thing.
Look I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you and you can do what you like with them. But dont do anything to these men for they have come under the protection of my roof.
Get out of our way they replied. And they said This fellow came here as an alien and now he wants to play the judge! Well treat you worse than them. They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.
Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old with blindness so that they could not find the door.
The two men said to Lot Do you have anyone else heresonsinlaw sons or daughters or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here
because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.
So Lot went out and spoke to his sonsinlaw who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said Hurry and get out of this place because the Lord is about to destroy the city! But his sonsinlaw thought he was joking.
With the coming of dawn the angels urged Lot saying Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here or you will be swept away when the city is punished.
When he hesitated the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city for the Lord was merciful to them.
As soon as they had brought them out one of them said Flee for your lives! Dont look back and dont stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!
But Lot said to them No my lords please!
Your servant has found favor in your eyes and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I cant flee to the mountains this disaster will overtake me and Ill die.
Look here is a town near enough to run to and it is small. Let me flee to itit is very small isnt it? Then my life will be spared.
He said to him Very well I will grant this request too I will not overthrow the town you speak of.
But flee there quickly because I cannot do anything until you reach it.
By the time Lot reached Zoar the sun had risen over the land.
Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrahfrom the Lord out of the heavens.
Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain including all those living in the citiesand also the vegetation in the land.
But Lots wife looked back and she became a pillar of salt.
Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord.
He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah toward all the land of the plain and he saw dense smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace.
So when God destroyed the cities of the plain he remembered Abraham and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.
One day the older daughter said to the younger Our father is old and there is no man around here to lie with us as is the custom all over the earth.
Lets get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.
That night they got their father to drink wine and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
The next day the older daughter said to the younger Last night I lay with my father. Lets get him to drink wine again tonight and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.
So they got their father to drink wine that night also and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
So both of Lots daughters became pregnant by their father.
The older daughter had a son and she named him Moab he is the father of the Moabites of today.
The younger daughter also had a son and she named him BenAmmi he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar
and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah She is my sister. Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.
But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken she is a married woman.
Now Abimelech had not gone near her so he said Lord will you destroy an innocent nation?
Did he not say to me She is my sister and didnt she also say He is my brother? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.
Then God said to him in the dream Yes I know you did this with a clear conscience and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.
Now return the mans wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her you may be sure that you and all yours will die.
Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials and when he told them all that had happened they were very much afraid.
Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.
And Abimelech asked Abraham What was your reason for doing this?
Abraham replied I said to myself There is surely no fear of God in this place and they will kill me because of my wife.
Besides she really is my sister the daughter of my father though not of my mother and she became my wife.
And when God had me wander from my fathers household I said to her This is how you can show your love to me Everywhere we go say of me He is my brother.  
Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham and he returned Sarah his wife to him.
And Abimelech said My land is before you live wherever you like.
To Sarah he said I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you you are completely vindicated.
Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech his wife and his slave girls so they could have children again
for the Lord had closed up every womb in Abimelechs household because of Abrahams wife Sarah.
Now the Lord was gracious to Sarah as he had said and the Lord did for Sarah what he had promised.
Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the very time God had promised him.
Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.
When his son Isaac was eight days old Abraham circumcised him as God commanded him.
Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Sarah said God has brought me laughter and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.
And she added Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.
The child grew and was weaned and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.
But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking
and she said to Abraham Get rid of that slave woman and her son for that slave womans son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.
The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.
But God said to him Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
I will make the son of the maidservant into a nation also because he is your offspring.
Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.
When the water in the skin was gone she put the boy under one of the bushes.
Then she went off and sat down nearby about a bowshot away for she thought I cannot watch the boy die. And as she sat there nearby she began to sob.
God heard the boy crying and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her What is the matter Hagar? Do not be afraid God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.
Lift the boy up and take him by the hand for I will make him into a great nation.
Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.
While he was living in the Desert of Paran his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.
At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham God is with you in everything you do.
Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you are living as an alien the same kindness I have shown to you.
Abraham said I swear it.
Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelechs servants had seized.
But Abimelech said I dont know who has done this. You did not tell me and I heard about it only today.
So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech and the two men made a treaty.
Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock
and Abimelech asked Abraham What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?
He replied Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.
So that place was called Beersheba because the two men swore an oath there.
After the treaty had been made at Beersheba Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and there he called upon the name of the Lord the Eternal God.
And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him Abraham! Here I am he replied.
Then God said Take your son your only son Isaac whom you love and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.
Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering he set out for the place God had told him about.
On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
He said to his servants Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you.
Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together
Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham Father? Yes my son? Abraham replied. The fire and wood are here Isaac said but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?
Abraham answered God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering my son. And the two of them went on together.
When they reached the place God had told him about Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.
Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven Abraham! Abraham! Here I am he replied.
Do not lay a hand on the boy he said. Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God because you have not withheld from me your son your only son.
Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
So Abraham called that place The Lord Will Provide. And to this day it is said On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.
The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time
and said I swear by myself declares the Lord that because you have done this and have not withheld your son your only son
I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies
and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed because you have obeyed me.
Then Abraham returned to his servants and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.
Some time later Abraham was told Milcah is also a mother she has borne sons to your brother Nahor
Uz the firstborn Buz his brother Kemuel 
Kesed Hazo Pildash Jidlaph and Bethuel.
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abrahams brother Nahor.
His concubine whose name was Reumah also had sons Tebah Gaham Tahash and Maacah.
Sarah lived to be a hundred and twentyseven years old.
She died at Kiriath Arba  in the land of Canaan and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.
Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said
I am an alien and a stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.
The Hittites replied to Abraham
Sir listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.
Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land the Hittites.
He said to them If you are willing to let me bury my dead then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.
Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.
No my lord he said. Listen to me I give you the field and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.
Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
and he said to Ephron in their hearing Listen to me if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.
Ephron answered Abraham
Listen to me my lord the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver but what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.
Abraham agreed to Ephrons terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites four hundred shekels of silver according to the weight current among the merchants.
So Ephrons field in Machpelah near Mamreboth the field and the cave in it and all the trees within the borders of the fieldwas deeded
to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.
Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre  in the land of Canaan.
So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
Abraham was now old and well advanced in years and the Lord had blessed him in every way.
He said to the chief servant in his household the one in charge of all that he had Put your hand under my thigh.
I want you to swear by the Lord the God of heaven and the God of earth that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living
but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.
The servant asked him What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?
Make sure that you do not take my son back there Abraham said.
The Lord the God of heaven who brought me out of my fathers household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath saying To your offspring I will give this landhe will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.
If the woman is unwilling to come back with you then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.
So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
Then the servant took ten of his masters camels and left taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor.
He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town it was toward evening the time the women go out to draw water.
Then he prayed O Lord God of my master Abraham give me success today and show kindness to my master Abraham.
See I am standing beside this spring and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
May it be that when I say to a girl Please let down your jar that I may have a drink and she says Drink and Ill water your camels toolet her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.
Before he had finished praying Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah who was the wife of Abrahams brother Nahor.
The girl was very beautiful a virgin no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring filled her jar and came up again.
The servant hurried to meet her and said Please give me a little water from your jar.
Drink my lord she said and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
After she had given him a drink she said Ill draw water for your camels too until they have finished drinking.
So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough ran back to the well to draw more water and drew enough for all his camels.
Without saying a word the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful.
When the camels had finished drinking the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.
Then he asked Whose daughter are you? Please tell me is there room in your fathers house for us to spend the night?
She answered him I am the daughter of Bethuel the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.
And she added We have plenty of straw and fodder as well as room for you to spend the night.
Then the man bowed down and worshiped the Lord
saying Praise be to the Lord the God of my master Abraham who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me the Lord has led me on the journey to the house of my masters relatives.
The girl ran and told her mothers household about these things.
Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban and he hurried out to the man at the spring.
As soon as he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sisters arms and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.
Come you who are blessed by the Lord he said. Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.
So the man went to the house and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels and water for him and his men to wash their feet.
Then food was set before him but he said I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say. Then tell us Laban said.
So he said I am Abrahams servant.
The Lord has blessed my master abundantly and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle silver and gold menservants and maidservants and camels and donkeys.
My masters wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age and he has given him everything he owns.
And my master made me swear an oath and said You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I live
but go to my fathers family and to my own clan and get a wife for my son.
Then I asked my master What if the woman will not come back with me?
He replied The Lord before whom I have walked will send his angel with you and make your journey a success so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my fathers family.
Then when you go to my clan you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to youyou will be released from my oath.
When I came to the spring today I said O Lord God of my master Abraham if you will please grant success to the journey on which I have come.
See I am standing beside this spring if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her Please let me drink a little water from your jar
and if she says to me Drink and Ill draw water for your camels too let her be the one the Lord has chosen for my masters son.
Before I finished praying in my heart Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water and I said to her Please give me a drink.
She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said Drink and Ill water your camels too. So I drank and she watered the camels also.
I asked her Whose daughter are you? She said The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor whom Milcah bore to him. Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms
and I bowed down and worshiped the Lord. I praised the Lord the God of my master Abraham who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my masters brother for his son.
Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master tell me and if not tell me so I may know which way to turn.
Laban and Bethuel answered This is from the Lord we can say nothing to you one way or the other.
Here is Rebekah take her and go and let her become the wife of your masters son as the Lord has directed.
When Abrahams servant heard what they said he bowed down to the ground before the Lord.
Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.
Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning he said Send me on my way to my master.
But her brother and her mother replied Let the girl remain with us ten days or so then you may go.
But he said to them Do not detain me now that the Lord has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.
Then they said Lets call the girl and ask her about it.
So they called Rebekah and asked her Will you go with this man? I will go she said.
So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way along with her nurse and Abrahams servant and his men.
And they blessed Rebekah and said to her Our sister may you increase to thousands upon thousands may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.
Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi for he was living in the Negev.
He went out to the field one evening to meditate and as he looked up he saw camels approaching.
Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel
and asked the servant Who is that man in the field coming to meet us? He is my master the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mothers death.
Abraham took another wife whose name was Keturah.
She bore him Zimran Jokshan Medan Midian Ishbak and Shuah.
Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites the Letushites and the Leummites.
The sons of Midian were Ephah Epher Hanoch Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
But while he was still living he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.
Altogether Abraham lived a hundred and seventyfive years.
Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age an old man and full of years and he was gathered to his people.
His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite
the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.
After Abrahams death God blessed his son Isaac who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.
This is the account of Abrahams son Ishmael whom Sarahs maidservant Hagar the Egyptian bore to Abraham.
These are the names of the sons of Ishmael listed in the order of their birth Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael Kedar Adbeel Mibsam
Mishma Dumah Massa
Hadad Tema Jetur Naphish and Kedemah.
These were the sons of Ishmael and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.
Altogether Ishmael lived a hundred and thirtyseven years. He breathed his last and died and he was gathered to his people.
His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.
This is the account of Abrahams son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac
and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife because she was barren. The Lord answered his prayer and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.
The babies jostled each other within her and she said Why is this happening to me? So she went to inquire of the Lord.
The Lord said to her Two nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you will be separated one people will be stronger than the other and the older will serve the younger.
When the time came for her to give birth there were twin boys in her womb.
The first to come out was red and his whole body was like a hairy garment so they named him Esau.
After this his brother came out with his hand grasping Esaus heel so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
The boys grew up and Esau became a skillful hunter a man of the open country while Jacob was a quiet man staying among the tents.
Isaac who had a taste for wild game loved Esau but Rebekah loved Jacob.
Once when Jacob was cooking some stew Esau came in from the open country famished.
He said to Jacob Quick let me have some of that red stew! Im famished!
Jacob replied First sell me your birthright.
Look I am about to die Esau said. What good is the birthright to me?
But Jacob said Swear to me first. So he swore an oath to him selling his birthright to Jacob.
Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
Now there was a famine in the landbesides the earlier famine of Abrahams timeand Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar.
The Lord appeared to Isaac and said Do not go down to Egypt live in the land where I tell you to live.
Stay in this land for a while and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.
I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed
because Abraham obeyed me and kept my requirements my commands my decrees and my laws.
So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
When the men of that place asked him about his wife he said She is my sister because he was afraid to say She is my wife. He thought The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah because she is beautiful.
When Isaac had been there a long time Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said She is really your wife! Why did you say She is my sister? Isaac answered him Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.
Then Abimelech said What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife and you would have brought guilt upon us.
So Abimelech gave orders to all the people Anyone who molests this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold because the Lord blessed him.
The man became rich and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.
He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.
So all the wells that his fathers servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham the Philistines stopped up filling them with earth.
Then Abimelech said to Isaac Move away from us you have become too powerful for us.
So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died and he gave them the same names his father had given them.
Isaacs servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.
But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaacs herdsmen and said The water is ours! So he named the well Esek because they disputed with him.
Then they dug another well but they quarreled over that one also so he named it Sitnah.
He moved on from there and dug another well and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth saying Now the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land.
From there he went up to Beersheba.
That night the Lord appeared to him and said I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid for I am with you I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.
Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord. There he pitched his tent and there his servants dug a well.
Meanwhile Abimelech had come to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.
Isaac asked them Why have you come to me since you were hostile to me and sent me away?
They answered We saw clearly that the Lord was with you so we said There ought to be a sworn agreement between usbetween us and you. Let us make a treaty with you
that you will do us no harm just as we did not molest you but always treated you well and sent you away in peace. And now you are blessed by the Lord.
Isaac then made a feast for them and they ate and drank.
Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way and they left him in peace.
That day Isaacs servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said Weve found water!
He called it Shibah and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.
When Esau was forty years old he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see he called for Esau his older son and said to him My son. Here I am he answered.
Isaac said I am now an old man and dont know the day of my death.
Now then get your weaponsyour quiver and bowand go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me.
Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat so that I may give you my blessing before I die.
Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back
Rebekah said to her son Jacob Look I overheard your father say to your brother Esau
Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die.
Now my son listen carefully and do what I tell you
Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats so I can prepare some tasty food for your father just the way he likes it.
Then take it to your father to eat so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.
Jacob said to Rebekah his mother But my brother Esau is a hairy man and Im a man with smooth skin.
What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.
His mother said to him My son let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say go and get them for me.
So he went and got them and brought them to his mother and she prepared some tasty food just the way his father liked it.
Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son which she had in the house and put them on her younger son Jacob.
She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.
Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
He went to his father and said My father. Yes my son he answered. Who is it?
Jacob said to his father I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing.
Isaac asked his son How did you find it so quickly my son? The Lord your God gave me success he replied.
Then Isaac said to Jacob Come near so I can touch you my son to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.
Jacob went close to his father Isaac who touched him and said The voice is the voice of Jacob but the hands are the hands of Esau.
He did not recognize him for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau so he blessed him.
Are you really my son Esau? he asked. I am he replied.
Then he said My son bring me some of your game to eat so that I may give you my blessing. Jacob brought it to him and he ate and he brought some wine and he drank.
Then his father Isaac said to him Come here my son and kiss me.
So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes he blessed him and said Ah the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed.
May God give you of heavens dew and of earths richness an abundance of grain and new wine.
May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.
After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had scarcely left his fathers presence his brother Esau came in from hunting.
He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him My father sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing.
His father Isaac asked him Who are you? I am your son he answered your firstborn Esau.
Isaac trembled violently and said Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed himand indeed he will be blessed!
When Esau heard his fathers words he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father Bless meme too my father!
But he said Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.
Esau said Isnt he rightly named Jacob? He has deceived me these two times He took my birthright and now hes taken my blessing! Then he asked Havent you reserved any blessing for me?
Isaac answered Esau I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you my son?
Esau said to his father Do you have only one blessing my father? Bless me too my father! Then Esau wept aloud.
His father Isaac answered him Your dwelling will be away from the earths richness away from the dew of heaven above.
You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless you will throw his yoke from off your neck.
Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself The days of mourning for my father are near then I will kill my brother Jacob.
When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you.
Now then my son do what I say Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.
Stay with him for a while until your brothers fury subsides.
When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him Ill send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?
Then Rebekah said to Isaac Im disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land from Hittite women like these my life will not be worth living.
So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him and commanded him Do not marry a Canaanite woman.
Go at once to Paddan Aram to the house of your mothers father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there from among the daughters of Laban your mothers brother.
May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.
May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as an alien the land God gave to Abraham.
Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way and he went to Paddan Aram to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean the brother of Rebekah who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there and that when he blessed him he commanded him Do not marry a Canaanite woman
and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.
Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac
so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham in addition to the wives he already had.
Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran.
When he reached a certain place he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.
He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth with its top reaching to heaven and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
There above it stood the Lord and he said I am the Lord the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.
Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth and you will spread out to the west and to the east to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.
When Jacob awoke from his sleep he thought Surely the Lord is in this place and I was not aware of it.
He was afraid and said How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God this is the gate of heaven.
Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.
He called that place Bethel though the city used to be called Luz.
Then Jacob made a vow saying If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear
so that I return safely to my fathers house then the Lord will be my God
and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be Gods house and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.
Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.
There he saw a well in the field with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large.
When all the flocks were gathered there the shepherds would roll the stone away from the wells mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
Jacob asked the shepherds My brothers where are you from? Were from Haran they replied.
He said to them Do you know Laban Nahors grandson? Yes we know him they answered.
Then Jacob asked them Is he well? Yes he is they said and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.
Look he said the sun is still high it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.
We cant they replied until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.
While he was still talking with them Rachel came with her fathers sheep for she was a shepherdess.
When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban his mothers brother and Labans sheep he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncles sheep.
Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.
He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.
As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob his sisters son he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home and there Jacob told him all these things.
Then Laban said to him You are my own flesh and blood. After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month
Laban said to him Just because you are a relative of mine should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.
Now Laban had two daughters the name of the older was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Leah had weak eyes but Rachel was lovely in form and beautiful.
Jacob was in love with Rachel and said Ill work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.
Laban said Its better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.
So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
Then Jacob said to Laban Give me my wife. My time is completed and I want to lie with her.
So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.
But when evening came he took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob and Jacob lay with her.
And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter as her maidservant.
When morning came there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel didnt I? Why have you deceived me?
Laban replied It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.
Finish this daughters bridal week then we will give you the younger one also in return for another seven years of work.
And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.
Jacob lay with Rachel also and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.
When the Lord saw that Leah was not loved he opened her womb but Rachel was barren.
Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben for she said It is because the Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.
She conceived again and when she gave birth to a son she said Because the Lord heard that I am not loved he gave me this one too. So she named him Simeon.
Again she conceived and when she gave birth to a son she said Now at last my husband will become attached to me because I have borne him three sons. So he was named Levi.
She conceived again and when she gave birth to a son she said This time I will praise the Lord. So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob Give me children or Ill die!
Jacob became angry with her and said Am I in the place of God who has kept you from having children?
Then she said Here is Bilhah my maidservant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and that through her I too can build a family.
So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her
and she became pregnant and bore him a son.
Then Rachel said God has vindicated me he has listened to my plea and given me a son. Because of this she named him Dan.
Rachels servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
Then Rachel said I have had a great struggle with my sister and I have won. So she named him Naphtali.
When Leah saw that she had stopped having children she took her maidservant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
Leahs servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
Then Leah said What good fortune! So she named him Gad.
Leahs servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
Then Leah said How happy I am! The women will call me happy. So she named him Asher.
During wheat harvest Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah Please give me some of your sons mandrakes.
But she said to her Wasnt it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my sons mandrakes too? Very well Rachel said he can sleep with you tonight in return for your sons mandrakes.
So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening Leah went out to meet him. You must sleep with me she said. I have hired you with my sons mandrakes. So he slept with her that night.
God listened to Leah and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.
Then Leah said God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband. So she named him Issachar.
Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
Then Leah said God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor because I have borne him six sons. So she named him Zebulun.
Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
Then God remembered Rachel he listened to her and opened her womb.
She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said God has taken away my disgrace.
She named him Joseph and said May the Lord add to me another son.
After Rachel gave birth to Joseph Jacob said to Laban Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.
Give me my wives and children for whom I have served you and I will be on my way. You know how much work Ive done for you.
But Laban said to him If I have found favor in your eyes please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you.
He added Name your wages and I will pay them.
Jacob said to him You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.
The little you had before I came has increased greatly and the Lord has blessed you wherever I have been. But now when may I do something for my own household?
What shall I give you? he asked. Dont give me anything Jacob replied. But if you will do this one thing for me I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them
Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep every darkcolored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.
And my honesty will testify for me in the future whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted or any lamb that is not darkcolored will be considered stolen.
Agreed said Laban. Let it be as you have said.
That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted and all the speckled or spotted female goats  and all the darkcolored lambs and he placed them in the care of his sons.
Then he put a threeday journey between himself and Jacob while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Labans flocks.
Jacob however took freshcut branches from poplar almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.
Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink
they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves but made the rest face the streaked and darkcolored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Labans animals.
Whenever the stronger females were in heat Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches
but if the animals were weak he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.
In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and donkeys.
Jacob heard that Labans sons were saying Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.
And Jacob noticed that Labans attitude toward him was not what it had been.
Then the Lord said to Jacob Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives and I will be with you.
So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.
He said to them I see that your fathers attitude toward me is not what it was before but the God of my father has been with me.
You know that Ive worked for your father with all my strength
yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However God has not allowed him to harm me.
If he said The speckled ones will be your wages then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young and if he said The streaked ones will be your wages then all the flocks bore streaked young.
So God has taken away your fathers livestock and has given them to me.
In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked speckled or spotted.
The angel of God said to me in the dream Jacob. I answered Here I am.
And he said Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked speckled or spotted for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
I am the God of Bethel where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land. 
Then Rachel and Leah replied Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our fathers estate?
Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us but he has used up what was paid for us.
Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.
Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels
and he drove all his livestock ahead of him along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
When Laban had gone to shear his sheep Rachel stole her fathers household gods.
Moreover Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.
So he fled with all he had and crossing the River he headed for the hill country of Gilead.
On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
Taking his relatives with him he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him Be careful not to say anything to Jacob either good or bad.
Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him and Laban and his relatives camped there too.
Then Laban said to Jacob What have you done? Youve deceived me and youve carried off my daughters like captives in war.
Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didnt you tell me so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps?
You didnt even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodby. You have done a foolish thing.
I have the power to harm you but last night the God of your father said to me Be careful not to say anything to Jacob either good or bad.
Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your fathers house. But why did you steal my gods?
Jacob answered Laban I was afraid because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
But if you find anyone who has your gods he shall not live. In the presence of our relatives see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me and if so take it. Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
So Laban went into Jacobs tent and into Leahs tent and into the tent of the two maidservants but he found nothing. After he came out of Leahs tent he entered Rachels tent.
Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camels saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
Rachel said to her father Dont be angry my lord that I cannot stand up in your presence Im having my period. So he searched but could not find the household gods.
Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. What is my crime? he asked Laban. What sin have I committed that you hunt me down?
Now that you have searched through all my goods what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine and let them judge between the two of us.
I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.
I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
This was my situation The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night and sleep fled from my eyes.
It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks and you changed my wages ten times.
If the God of my father the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac had not been with me you would surely have sent me away emptyhanded. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands and last night he rebuked you.
Laban answered Jacob The women are my daughters the children are my children and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or about the children they have borne?
Come now lets make a covenant you and I and let it serve as a witness between us.
So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
He said to his relatives Gather some stones. So they took stones and piled them in a heap and they ate there by the heap.
Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha and Jacob called it Galeed.
Laban said This heap is a witness between you and me today. That is why it was called Galeed.
It was also called Mizpah because he said May the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.
If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters even though no one is with us remember that God is a witness between you and me.
Laban also said to Jacob Here is this heap and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
This heap is a witness and this pillar is a witness that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.
May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor the God of their father judge between us. So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten they spent the night there.
Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
Jacob also went on his way and the angels of God met him.
When Jacob saw them he said This is the camp of God! So he named that place Mahanaim.
Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir the country of Edom.
He instructed them This is what you are to say to my master Esau Your servant Jacob says I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.
I have cattle and donkeys sheep and goats menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord that I may find favor in your eyes. 
When the messengers returned to Jacob they said We went to your brother Esau and now he is coming to meet you and four hundred men are with him.
In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups and the flocks and herds and camels as well.
He thought If Esau comes and attacks one group the group that is left may escape.
Then Jacob prayed O God of my father Abraham God of my father Isaac O Lord who said to me Go back to your country and your relatives and I will make you prosper
I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan but now I have become two groups.
Save me I pray from the hand of my brother Esau for I am afraid he will come and attack me and also the mothers with their children.
But you have said I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea which cannot be counted. 
He spent the night there and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau
two hundred female goats and twenty male goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams
thirty female camels with their young forty cows and ten bulls and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
He put them in the care of his servants each herd by itself and said to his servants Go ahead of me and keep some space between the herds.
He instructed the one in the lead When my brother Esau meets you and asks To whom do you belong and where are you going and who owns all these animals in front of you?
then you are to say They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau and he is coming behind us. 
He also instructed the second the third and all the others who followed the herds You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
And be sure to say Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.  For he thought I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead later when I see him perhaps he will receive me.
So Jacobs gifts went on ahead of him but he himself spent the night in the camp.
That night Jacob got up and took his two wives his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
After he had sent them across the stream he sent over all his possessions.
So Jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.
When the man saw that he could not overpower him he touched the socket of Jacobs hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
Then the man said Let me go for it is daybreak. But Jacob replied I will not let you go unless you bless me.
The man asked him What is your name? Jacob he answered.
Then the man said Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome.
Jacob said Please tell me your name. But he replied Why do you ask my name? Then he blessed him there.
So Jacob called the place Peniel saying It is because I saw God face to face and yet my life was spared.
The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel and he was limping because of his hip.
Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip because the socket of Jacobs hip was touched near the tendon.
Jacob looked up and there was Esau coming with his four hundred men so he divided the children among Leah Rachel and the two maidservants.
He put the maidservants and their children in front Leah and her children next and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.
He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.
Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. Who are these with you? he asked. Jacob answered They are the children God has graciously given your servant.
Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.
Next Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel and they too bowed down.
Esau asked What do you mean by all these droves I met? To find favor in your eyes my lord he said.
But Esau said I already have plenty my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.
No please! said Jacob. If I have found favor in your eyes accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God now that you have received me favorably.
Please accept the present that was brought to you for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need. And because Jacob insisted Esau accepted it.
Then Esau said Let us be on our way Ill accompany you.
But Jacob said to him My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day all the animals will die.
So let my lord go on ahead of his servant while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children until I come to my lord in Seir.
Esau said Then let me leave some of my men with you. But why do that? Jacob asked. Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.
So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.
Jacob however went to Succoth where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.
After Jacob came from Paddan Aram he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.
For a hundred pieces of silver he bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.
There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.
Now Dinah the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob went out to visit the women of the land.
When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite the ruler of that area saw her he took her and violated her.
His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.
And Shechem said to his father Hamor Get me this girl as my wife.
When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled his sons were in the fields with his livestock so he kept quiet about it until they came home.
Then Shechems father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
Now Jacobs sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were filled with grief and fury because Shechem had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacobs daughtera thing that should not be done.
But Hamor said to them My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
Intermarry with us give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.
You can settle among us the land is open to you. Live in it trade in it and acquire property in it.
Then Shechem said to Dinahs father and brothers Let me find favor in your eyes and I will give you whatever you ask.
Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like and Ill pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the girl as my wife.
Because their sister Dinah had been defiled Jacobs sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.
They said to them We cant do such a thing we cant give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.
We will give our consent to you on one condition only that you become like us by circumcising all your males.
Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. Well settle among you and become one people with you.
But if you will not agree to be circumcised well take our sister and go.
Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
The young man who was the most honored of all his fathers household lost no time in doing what they said because he was delighted with Jacobs daughter.
So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to their fellow townsmen.
These men are friendly toward us they said. Let them live in our land and trade in it the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.
But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised as they themselves are.
Wont their livestock their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us give our consent to them and they will settle among us.
All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem and every male in the city was circumcised.
Three days later while all of them were still in pain two of Jacobs sons Simeon and Levi Dinahs brothers took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city killing every male.
They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechems house and left.
The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled.
They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.
They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children taking as plunder everything in the houses.
Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites the people living in this land. We are few in number and if they join forces against me and attack me I and my household will be destroyed.
But they replied Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?
Then God said to Jacob Go up to Bethel and settle there and build an altar there to God who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.
So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you and purify yourselves and change your clothes.
Then come let us go up to Bethel where I will build an altar to God who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.
So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.
Then they set out and the terror of God fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.
Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz  in the land of Canaan.
There he built an altar and he called the place El Bethel because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
Now Deborah Rebekahs nurse died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So it was named Allon Bacuth.
After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram God appeared to him again and blessed him.
God said to him Your name is Jacob but you will no longer be called Jacob your name will be Israel. So he named him Israel.
And God said to him I am God Almighty be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you and kings will come from your body.
The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you and I will give this land to your descendants after you.
Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.
Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him and he poured out a drink offering on it he also poured oil on it.
Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.
Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.
And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth the midwife said to her Dont be afraid for you have another son.
As she breathed her lastfor she was dyingshe named her son BenOni. But his father named him Benjamin.
So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath .
Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar and to this day that pillar marks Rachels tomb.
Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
While Israel was living in that region Reuben went in and slept with his fathers concubine Bilhah and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons
The sons of Leah Reuben the firstborn of Jacob Simeon Levi Judah Issachar and Zebulun.
The sons of Rachel Joseph and Benjamin.
The sons of Rachels maidservant Bilhah Dan and Naphtali.
The sons of Leahs maidservant Zilpah Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre near Kiriath Arba  where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.
Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
This is the account of Esau .
Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite

Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau Basemath bore Reuel
and Oholibamah bore Jeush Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in Canaan.
Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob.
Their possessions were too great for them to remain together the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock.
So Esau  settled in the hill country of Seir.

Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom according to their settlements in the land they occupied. This was Esau the father of the Edomites.
Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed the land of Canaan.
This is the account of Jacob. Joseph a young man of seventeen was tending the flocks with his brothers the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah his fathers wives and he brought their father a bad report about them.
Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons because he had been born to him in his old age and he made a richly ornamented robe for him.
When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
Joseph had a dream and when he told it to his brothers they hated him all the more.
He said to them Listen to this dream I had
We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.
His brothers said to him Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us? And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
Then he had another dream and he told it to his brothers. Listen he said I had another dream and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.
When he told his father as well as his brothers his father rebuked him and said What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?
His brothers were jealous of him but his father kept the matter in mind.
Now his brothers had gone to graze their fathers flocks near Shechem
and Israel said to Joseph As you know your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come I am going to send you to them. Very well he replied.
So he said to him Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks and bring word back to me. Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem
a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him What are you looking for?
He replied Im looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?
They have moved on from here the man answered. I heard them say Lets go to Dothan.  So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.
But they saw him in the distance and before he reached them they plotted to kill him.
Here comes that dreamer! they said to each other.
Come now lets kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then well see what comes of his dreams.
When Reuben heard this he tried to rescue him from their hands. Lets not take his life he said.
Dont shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert but dont lay a hand on him. Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
So when Joseph came to his brothers they stripped him of his robethe richly ornamented robe he was wearing
and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty there was no water in it.
As they sat down to eat their meal they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices balm and myrrh and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
Judah said to his brothers What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
Come lets sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him after all he is our brother our own flesh and blood. His brothers agreed.
So when the Midianite merchants came by his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites who took him to Egypt.
When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there he tore his clothes.
He went back to his brothers and said The boy isnt there! Where can I turn now?
Then they got Josephs robe slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your sons robe.
He recognized it and said It is my sons robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.
Then Jacob tore his clothes put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.
All his sons and daughters came to comfort him but he refused to be comforted. No he said in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son. So his father wept for him.
Meanwhile the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar one of Pharaohs officials the captain of the guard.
At that time Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.
There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son who was named Er.
She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.
She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.
Judah got a wife for Er his firstborn and her name was Tamar.
But Er Judahs firstborn was wicked in the Lords sight so the Lord put him to death.
Then Judah said to Onan Lie with your brothers wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brotherinlaw to produce offspring for your brother.
But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his so whenever he lay with his brothers wife he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother.
What he did was wicked in the Lords sight so he put him to death also.
Judah then said to his daughterinlaw Tamar Live as a widow in your fathers house until my son Shelah grows up. For he thought He may die too just like his brothers. So Tamar went to live in her fathers house.
After a long time Judahs wife the daughter of Shua died. When Judah had recovered from his grief he went up to Timnah to the men who were shearing his sheep and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him.
When Tamar was told Your fatherinlaw is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep
she took off her widows clothes covered herself with a veil to disguise herself and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that though Shelah had now grown up she had not been given to him as his wife.
When Judah saw her he thought she was a prostitute for she had covered her face.
Not realizing that she was his daughterinlaw he went over to her by the roadside and said Come now let me sleep with you. And what will you give me to sleep with you? she asked.
Ill send you a young goat from my flock he said. Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it? she asked.
He said What pledge should I give you? Your seal and its cord and the staff in your hand she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her and she became pregnant by him.
After she left she took off her veil and put on her widows clothes again.
Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman but he did not find her.
He asked the men who lived there Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim? There hasnt been any shrine prostitute here they said.
So he went back to Judah and said I didnt find her. Besides the men who lived there said There hasnt been any shrine prostitute here. 
Then Judah said Let her keep what she has or we will become a laughingstock. After all I did send her this young goat but you didnt find her.
About three months later Judah was told Your daughterinlaw Tamar is guilty of prostitution and as a result she is now pregnant. Judah said Bring her out and have her burned to death!
As she was being brought out she sent a message to her fatherinlaw. I am pregnant by the man who owns these she said. And she added See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.
Judah recognized them and said She is more righteous than I since I wouldnt give her to my son Shelah. And he did not sleep with her again.
When the time came for her to give birth there were twin boys in her womb.
As she was giving birth one of them put out his hand so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said This one came out first.
But when he drew back his hand his brother came out and she said So this is how you have broken out! And he was named Perez.
Then his brother who had the scarlet thread on his wrist came out and he was given the name Zerah.
Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar an Egyptian who was one of Pharaohs officials the captain of the guard bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
The Lord was with Joseph and he prospered and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did
Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.
From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had both in the house and in the field.
So he left in Josephs care everything he had with Joseph in charge he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was wellbuilt and handsome
and after a while his masters wife took notice of Joseph and said Come to bed with me!
But he refused. With me in charge he told her my master does not concern himself with anything in the house everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.
No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?
And though she spoke to Joseph day after day he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
One day he went into the house to attend to his duties and none of the household servants was inside.
She caught him by his cloak and said Come to bed with me! But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house
she called her household servants. Look she said to them this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me but I screamed.
When he heard me scream for help he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.
She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
Then she told him this story That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
But as soon as I screamed for help he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.
When his master heard the story his wife told him saying This is how your slave treated me he burned with anger.
Josephs master took him and put him in prison the place where the kings prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison
the Lord was with him he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison and he was made responsible for all that was done there.
The warden paid no attention to anything under Josephs care because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
Some time later the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master the king of Egypt.
Pharaoh was angry with his two officials the chief cupbearer and the chief baker
and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time
each of the two menthe cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt who were being held in prisonhad a dream the same night and each dream had a meaning of its own.
When Joseph came to them the next morning he saw that they were dejected.
So he asked Pharaohs officials who were in custody with him in his masters house Why are your faces so sad today?
We both had dreams they answered but there is no one to interpret them. Then Joseph said to them Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.
So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him In my dream I saw a vine in front of me
and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded it blossomed and its clusters ripened into grapes.
Pharaohs cup was in my hand and I took the grapes squeezed them into Pharaohs cup and put the cup in his hand.
This is what it means Joseph said to him. The three branches are three days.
Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position and you will put Pharaohs cup in his hand just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
But when all goes well with you remember me and show me kindness mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.
For I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.
When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation he said to Joseph I too had a dream On my head were three baskets of bread.
In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.
This is what it means Joseph said. The three baskets are three days.
Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat away your flesh.
Now the third day was Pharaohs birthday and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials
He restored the chief cupbearer to his position so that he once again put the cup into Pharaohs hand
but he hanged the chief baker just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
The chief cupbearer however did not remember Joseph he forgot him.
When two full years had passed Pharaoh had a dream He was standing by the Nile
when out of the river there came up seven cows sleek and fat and they grazed among the reeds.
After them seven other cows ugly and gaunt came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.
And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
He fell asleep again and had a second dream Seven heads of grain healthy and good were growing on a single stalk.
After them seven other heads of grain sproutedthin and scorched by the east wind.
The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up it had been a dream.
In the morning his mind was troubled so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams but no one could interpret them for him.
Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.
Pharaoh was once angry with his servants and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
Each of us had a dream the same night and each dream had a meaning of its own.
Now a young Hebrew was there with us a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams and he interpreted them for us giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us I was restored to my position and the other man was hanged.
So Pharaoh sent for Joseph and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes he came before Pharaoh.
Pharaoh said to Joseph I had a dream and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.
I cannot do it Joseph replied to Pharaoh but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile
when out of the river there came up seven cows fat and sleek and they grazed among the reeds.
After them seven other cows came upscrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.
The lean ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.
But even after they ate them no one could tell that they had done so they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain full and good growing on a single stalk.
After them seven other heads sproutedwithered and thin and scorched by the east wind.
The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians but none could explain it to me.
Then Joseph said to Pharaoh The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
The seven good cows are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years it is one and the same dream.
The seven lean ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind They are seven years of famine.
It is just as I said to Pharaoh God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt
but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten and the famine will ravage the land.
The abundance in the land will not be remembered because the famine that follows it will be so severe.
The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God and God will do it soon.
And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh to be kept in the cities for food.
This food should be held in reserve for the country to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.
The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.
So Pharaoh asked them Can we find anyone like this man one in whom is the spirit of God?
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph Since God has made all this known to you there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
You shall be in charge of my palace and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.
So Pharaoh said to Joseph I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Josephs finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
He had him ride in a chariot as his secondincommand and men shouted before him Make way! Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
Then Pharaoh said to Joseph I am Pharaoh but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.
Pharaoh gave Joseph the name ZaphenathPaneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaohs presence and traveled throughout Egypt.
During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.
Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.
Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain like the sand of the sea it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.
Before the years of famine came two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On.
Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my fathers household.
The second son he named Ephraim and said It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.
The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end
and the seven years of famine began just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.
When all Egypt began to feel the famine the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.
When the famine had spread over the whole country Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.
And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph because the famine was severe in all the world.
When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt he said to his sons Why do you just keep looking at each other?
He continued I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us so that we may live and not die.
Then ten of Josephs brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
But Jacob did not send Benjamin Josephs brother with the others because he was afraid that harm might come to him.
So Israels sons were among those who went to buy grain for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.
Now Joseph was the governor of the land the one who sold grain to all its people. So when Josephs brothers arrived they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
As soon as Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. Where do you come from? he asked. From the land of Canaan they replied to buy food.
Although Joseph recognized his brothers they did not recognize him.
Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.
No my lord they answered. Your servants have come to buy food.
We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men not spies.
No! he said to them. You have come to see where our land is unprotected.
But they replied Your servants were twelve brothers the sons of one man who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father and one is no more.
Joseph said to them It is just as I told you You are spies!
And this is how you will be tested As surely as Pharaoh lives you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
Send one of your number to get your brother the rest of you will be kept in prison so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not then as surely as Pharaoh lives you are spies!
And he put them all in custody for three days.
On the third day Joseph said to them Do this and you will live for I fear God
If you are honest men let one of your brothers stay here in prison while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.
But you must bring your youngest brother to me so that your words may be verified and that you may not die. This they proceeded to do.
They said to one another Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life but we would not listen thats why this distress has come upon us.
Reuben replied Didnt I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldnt listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.
They did not realize that Joseph could understand them since he was using an interpreter.
He turned away from them and began to weep but then turned back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.
Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain to put each mans silver back in his sack and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them
they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.
My silver has been returned he said to his brothers. Here it is in my sack. Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said What is this that God has done to us?
When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan they told him all that had happened to them. They said
The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.
But we said to him We are honest men we are not spies.
We were twelve brothers sons of one father. One is no more and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.
Then the man who is lord over the land said to us This is how I will know whether you are honest men Leave one of your brothers here with me and take food for your starving households and go.
But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you and you can trade in the land. 
As they were emptying their sacks there in each mans sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches they were frightened.
Their father Jacob said to them You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!
Then Reuben said to his father You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care and I will bring him back.
But Jacob said My son will not go down there with you his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.
Now the famine was still severe in the land.
So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt their father said to them Go back and buy us a little more food.
But Judah said to him The man warned us solemnly You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.
If you will send our brother along with us we will go down and buy food for you.
But if you will not send him we will not go down because the man said to us You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you. 
Israel asked Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?
They replied The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. Is your father still living? he asked us. Do you have another brother? We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say Bring your brother down here?
Then Judah said to Israel his father Send the boy along with me and we will go at once so that we and you and our children may live and not die.
I myself will guarantee his safety you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you I will bear the blame before you all my life.
As it is if we had not delayed we could have gone and returned twice.
Then their father Israel said to them If it must be then do this Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gifta little balm and a little honey some spices and myrrh some pistachio nuts and almonds.
Take double the amount of silver with you for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.
Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.
And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me if I am bereaved I am bereaved.
So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.
When Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house Take these men to my house slaughter an animal and prepare dinner they are to eat with me at noon.
The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Josephs house.
Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys.
So they went up to Josephs steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
Please sir they said we came down here the first time to buy food.
But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silverthe exact weightin the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.
We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We dont know who put our silver in our sacks.
Its all right he said. Dont be afraid. Your God the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks I received your silver. Then he brought Simeon out to them.
The steward took the men into Josephs house gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.
They prepared their gifts for Josephs arrival at noon because they had heard that they were to eat there.
When Joseph came home they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house and they bowed down before him to the ground.
He asked them how they were and then he said How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?
They replied Your servant our father is still alive and well. And they bowed low to pay him honor.
As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin his own mothers son he asked Is this your youngest brother the one you told me about? And he said God be gracious to you my son.
Deeply moved at the sight of his brother Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.
After he had washed his face he came out and controlling himself said Serve the food.
They served him by himself the brothers by themselves and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews for that is detestable to Egyptians.
The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages from the firstborn to the youngest and they looked at each other in astonishment.
When portions were served to them from Josephs table Benjamins portion was five times as much as anyone elses. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house Fill the mens sacks with as much food as they can carry and put each mans silver in the mouth of his sack.
Then put my cup the silver one in the mouth of the youngest ones sack along with the silver for his grain. And he did as Joseph said.
As morning dawned the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward Go after those men at once and when you catch up with them say to them Why have you repaid good with evil?
Isnt this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done. 
When he caught up with them he repeated these words to them.
But they said to him Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!
We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your masters house?
If any of your servants is found to have it he will die and the rest of us will become my lords slaves.
Very well then he said let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave the rest of you will be free from blame.
Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
Then the steward proceeded to search beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamins sack.
At this they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in and they threw themselves to the ground before him.
Joseph said to them What is this you have done? Dont you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?
What can we say to my lord? Judah replied. What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants guilt. We are now my lords slaveswe ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup.
But Joseph said Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you go back to your father in peace.
Then Judah went up to him and said Please my lord let your servant speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.
My lord asked his servants Do you have a father or a brother?
And we answered We have an aged father and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead and he is the only one of his mothers sons left and his father loves him.
Then you said to your servants Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.
And we said to my lord The boy cannot leave his father if he leaves him his father will die.
But you told your servants Unless your youngest brother comes down with you you will not see my face again.
When we went back to your servant my father we told him what my lord had said.
Then our father said Go back and buy a little more food.
But we said We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the mans face unless our youngest brother is with us.
Your servant my father said to us You know that my wife bore me two sons.
One of them went away from me and I said He has surely been torn to pieces. And I have not seen him since.
If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.
Your servant guaranteed the boys safety to my father. I said If I do not bring him back to you I will bear the blame before you my father all my life!
Now then please let your servant remain here as my lords slave in place of the boy and let the boy return with his brothers.
How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come upon my father.
Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants and he cried out Have everyone leave my presence! So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.
And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him and Pharaohs household heard about it.
Joseph said to his brothers I am Joseph! Is my father still living? But his brothers were not able to answer him because they were terrified at his presence.
Then Joseph said to his brothers Come close to me. When they had done so he said I am your brother Joseph the one you sold into Egypt!
And now do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.
For two years now there has been famine in the land and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping.
But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
So then it was not you who sent me here but God. He made me father to Pharaoh lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.
Now hurry back to my father and say to him This is what your son Joseph says God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me dont delay.
You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near meyou your children and grandchildren your flocks and herds and all you have.
I will provide for you there because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.
You can see for yourselves and so can my brother Benjamin that it is really I who am speaking to you.
Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.
Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept and Benjamin embraced him weeping.
And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.
When the news reached Pharaohs palace that Josephs brothers had come Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.
Pharaoh said to Joseph Tell your brothers Do this Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan
and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.
You are also directed to tell them Do this Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives and get your father and come.
Never mind about your belongings because the best of all Egypt will be yours. 
So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts as Pharaoh had commanded and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
To each of them he gave new clothing but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.
And this is what he sent to his father ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.
Then he sent his brothers away and as they were leaving he said to them Dont quarrel on the way!
So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
They told him Joseph is still alive! In fact he is ruler of all Egypt. Jacob was stunned he did not believe them.
But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
And Israel said Im convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.
So Israel set out with all that was his and when he reached Beersheba he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said Jacob! Jacob! Here I am he replied.
I am God the God of your father he said. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt for I will make you into a great nation there.
I will go down to Egypt with you and I will surely bring you back again. And Josephs own hand will close your eyes.
Then Jacob left Beersheba and Israels sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him.
They also took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt.
He took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughtersall his offspring.
These are the names of the sons of Israel  who went to Egypt Reuben the firstborn of Jacob.
The sons of Reuben Hanoch Pallu Hezron and Carmi.
The sons of Simeon Jemuel Jamin Ohad Jakin Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
The sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari.
The sons of Judah Er Onan Shelah Perez and Zerah . The sons of Perez Hezron and Hamul.
The sons of Issachar Tola Puah Jashub and Shimron.
The sons of Zebulun Sered Elon and Jahleel.
These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirtythree in all.
The sons of Gad Zephon Haggi Shuni Ezbon Eri Arodi and Areli.
The sons of Asher Imnah Ishvah Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah Heber and Malkiel.
These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah whom Laban had given to his daughter Leahsixteen in all.
The sons of Jacobs wife Rachel Joseph and Benjamin.
In Egypt Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On.
The sons of Benjamin Bela Beker Ashbel Gera Naaman Ehi Rosh Muppim Huppim and Ard.
These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacobfourteen in all.
The son of Dan Hushim.
The sons of Naphtali Jahziel Guni Jezer and Shillem.
These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachelseven in all.
All those who went to Egypt with Jacobthose who were his direct descendants not counting his sons wivesnumbered sixtysix persons.
With the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt the members of Jacobs family which went to Egypt were seventy in all.
Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen
Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time.
Israel said to Joseph Now I am ready to die since I have seen for myself that you are still alive.
Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers household I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him My brothers and my fathers household who were living in the land of Canaan have come to me.
The men are shepherds they tend livestock and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.
When Pharaoh calls you in and asks What is your occupation?
you should answer Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on just as our fathers did. Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.
Joseph went and told Pharaoh My father and brothers with their flocks and herds and everything they own have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.
He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
Pharaoh asked the brothers What is your occupation? Your servants are shepherds they replied to Pharaoh just as our fathers were.
They also said to him We have come to live here awhile because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants flocks have no pasture. So now please let your servants settle in Goshen.
Pharaoh said to Joseph Your father and your brothers have come to you
and the land of Egypt is before you settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability put them in charge of my own livestock.
Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh
Pharaoh asked him How old are you?
And Jacob said to Pharaoh The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.
Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land the district of Rameses as Pharaoh directed.
Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his fathers household with food according to the number of their children.
There was no food however in the whole region because the famine was severe both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine.
Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying and he brought it to Pharaohs palace.
When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone all Egypt came to Joseph and said Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is used up.
Then bring your livestock said Joseph. I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock since your money is gone.
So they brought their livestock to Joseph and he gave them food in exchange for their horses their sheep and goats their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock.
When that year was over they came to him the following year and said We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
Why should we perish before your eyeswe and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die and that the land may not become desolate.
So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians one and all sold their fields because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaohs
and Joseph reduced the people to servitude from one end of Egypt to the other.
However he did not buy the land of the priests because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
Joseph said to the people Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh here is seed for you so you can plant the ground.
But when the crop comes in give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other fourfifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children.
You have saved our lives they said. May we find favor in the eyes of our lord we will be in bondage to Pharaoh.
So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egyptstill in force todaythat a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaohs.
Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number.
Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years and the years of his life were a hundred and fortyseven.
When the time drew near for Israel to die he called for his son Joseph and said to him If I have found favor in your eyes put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt
but when I rest with my fathers carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried. I will do as you say he said.
Swear to me he said. Then Joseph swore to him and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
Some time later Joseph was told Your father is ill. So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.
When Jacob was told Your son Joseph has come to you Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.
Jacob said to Joseph God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and there he blessed me
and said to me I am going to make you fruitful and will increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.
Now then your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
Any children born to you after them will be yours in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.
As I was returning from Paddan to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath .
When Israel saw the sons of Joseph he asked Who are these?
They are the sons God has given me here Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said Bring them to me so I may bless them.
Now Israels eyes were failing because of old age and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him and his father kissed them and embraced them.
Israel said to Joseph I never expected to see your face again and now God has allowed me to see your children too.
Then Joseph removed them from Israels knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.
And Joseph took both of them Ephraim on his right toward Israels left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israels right hand and brought them close to him.
But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraims head though he was the younger and crossing his arms he put his left hand on Manassehs head even though Manasseh was the firstborn.
Then he blessed Joseph and said May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day
the Angel who has delivered me from all harm may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac and may they increase greatly upon the earth.
When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraims head he was displeased so he took hold of his fathers hand to move it from Ephraims head to Manassehs head.
Joseph said to him No my father this one is the firstborn put your right hand on his head.
But his father refused and said I know my son I know. He too will become a people and he too will become great. Nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he and his descendants will become a group of nations.
He blessed them that day and said In your name will Israel pronounce this blessing May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.  So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
Then Israel said to Joseph I am about to die but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers.
And to you as one who is over your brothers I give the ridge of land I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.
Then Jacob called for his sons and said Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.
Assemble and listen sons of Jacob listen to your father Israel.
Reuben you are my firstborn my might the first sign of my strength excelling in honor excelling in power.
Turbulent as the waters you will no longer excel for you went up onto your fathers bed onto my couch and defiled it.
Simeon and Levi are brothers their swords are weapons of violence.
Let me not enter their council let me not join their assembly for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.
Cursed be their anger so fierce and their fury so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel.
Judah your brothers will praise you your hand will be on the neck of your enemies your fathers sons will bow down to you.
You are a lions cub O Judah you return from the prey my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down like a lionesswho dares to rouse him?
The scepter will not depart from Judah nor the rulers staff from between his feet until he comes to whom it belongs and the obedience of the nations is his.
He will tether his donkey to a vine his colt to the choicest branch he will wash his garments in wine his robes in the blood of grapes.
His eyes will be darker than wine his teeth whiter than milk.
Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships his border will extend toward Sidon.
Issachar is a rawboned donkey lying down between two saddlebags.
When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor.
Dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
Dan will be a serpent by the roadside a viper along the path that bites the horses heels so that its rider tumbles backward.
I look for your deliverance O Lord.
Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders but he will attack them at their heels.
Ashers food will be rich he will provide delicacies fit for a king.
Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.
Joseph is a fruitful vine a fruitful vine near a spring whose branches climb over a wall.
With bitterness archers attacked him they shot at him with hostility.
But his bow remained steady his strong arms stayed limber because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob because of the Shepherd the Rock of Israel
because of your fathers God who helps you because of the Almighty who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above blessings of the deep that lies below blessings of the breast and womb.
Your fathers blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains than the bounty of the ageold hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
Benjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning he devours the prey in the evening he divides the plunder.
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them giving each the blessing appropriate to him.
Then he gave them these instructions I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite
the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre in Canaan which Abraham bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite along with the field.
There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried and there I buried Leah.
The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites.
When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons he drew his feet up into the bed breathed his last and was gathered to his people.
Joseph threw himself upon his father and wept over him and kissed him.
Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him
taking a full forty days for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
When the days of mourning had passed Joseph said to Pharaohs court If I have found favor in your eyes speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him
My father made me swear an oath and said I am about to die bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan. Now let me go up and bury my father then I will return. 
Pharaoh said Go up and bury your father as he made you swear to do.
So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaohs officials accompanied himthe dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt
besides all the members of Josephs household and his brothers and those belonging to his fathers household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.
Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company.
When they reached the threshing floor of Atad near the Jordan they lamented loudly and bitterly and there Joseph observed a sevenday period of mourning for his father.
When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad they said The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning. That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.
So Jacobs sons did as he had commanded them
They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre which Abraham had bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite along with the field.
After burying his father Joseph returned to Egypt together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.
When Josephs brothers saw that their father was dead they said What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?
So they sent word to Joseph saying Your father left these instructions before he died
This is what you are to say to Joseph I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly. Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father. When their message came to him Joseph wept.
His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. We are your slaves they said.
But Joseph said to them Dont be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
You intended to harm me but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done the saving of many lives.
So then dont be afraid. I will provide for you and your children. And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
Joseph stayed in Egypt along with all his fathers family. He lived a hundred and ten years
and saw the third generation of Ephraims children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Josephs knees.
Then Joseph said to his brothers I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath and said God will surely come to your aid and then you must carry my bones up from this place.
So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob each with his family
Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah
Issachar Zebulun and Benjamin
Dan and Naphtali Gad and Asher.
The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all Joseph was already in Egypt.
Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died
but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous so that the land was filled with them.
Then a new king who did not know about Joseph came to power in Egypt.
Look he said to his people the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.
Come we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and if war breaks out will join our enemies fight against us and leave the country.
So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
But the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied and spread so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
and worked them ruthlessly.
They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.
The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives whose names were Shiphrah and Puah
When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool if it is a boy kill him but if it is a girl let her live.
The midwives however feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do they let the boys live.
Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?
The midwives answered Pharaoh Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.
Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile but let every girl live.
Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman
and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child she hid him for three months.
But when she could hide him no longer she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
Then Pharaohs daughter went down to the Nile to bathe and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.
She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying and she felt sorry for him. This is one of the Hebrew babies she said.
Then his sister asked Pharaohs daughter Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?
Yes go she answered. And the girl went and got the babys mother.
Pharaohs daughter said to her Take this baby and nurse him for me and I will pay you. So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
When the child grew older she took him to Pharaohs daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses saying I drew him out of the water.
One day after Moses had grown up he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew one of his own people.
Glancing this way and that and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?
The man said Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian? Then Moses was afraid and thought What I did must have become known.
When Pharaoh heard of this he tried to kill Moses but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian where he sat down by a well.
Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their fathers flock.
Some shepherds came along and drove them away but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.
When the girls returned to Reuel their father he asked them Why have you returned so early today?
They answered An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.
And where is he? he asked his daughters. Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.
Moses agreed to stay with the man who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
Zipporah gave birth to a son and Moses named him Gershom saying I have become an alien in a foreign land.
During that long period the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.
God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob.
So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his fatherinlaw the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb the mountain of God.
There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
So Moses thought I will go over and see this strange sightwhy the bush does not burn up.
When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look God called to him from within the bush Moses! Moses! And Moses said Here I am.
Do not come any closer God said. Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
Then he said I am the God of your father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. At this Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.
The Lord said I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and I am concerned about their suffering.
So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land a land flowing with milk and honeythe home of the Canaanites Hittites Amorites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites.
And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
So now go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.
But Moses said to God Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?
And God said I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you When you have brought the people out of Egypt you will worship God on this mountain.
Moses said to God Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them The God of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me What is his name? Then what shall I tell them?
God said to Moses I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites I AM has sent me to you. 
God also said to Moses Say to the Israelites The Lord the God of your fathersthe God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacobhas sent me to you. This is my name forever the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.
Go assemble the elders of Israel and say to them The Lord the God of your fathersthe God of Abraham Isaac and Jacobappeared to me and said I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites Hittites Amorites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusitesa land flowing with milk and honey.
The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him The Lord the God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us take a threeday journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.
But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that he will let you go.
And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people so that when you leave you will not go emptyhanded.
Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.
Moses answered What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say The Lord did not appear to you?
Then the Lord said to him What is that in your hand? A staff he replied.
The Lord said Throw it on the ground. Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake and he ran from it.
Then the Lord said to him Reach out your hand and take it by the tail. So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
This said the Lord is so that they may believe that the Lord the God of their fathersthe God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacobhas appeared to you.
Then the Lord said Put your hand inside your cloak. So Moses put his hand into his cloak and when he took it out it was leprous like snow.
Now put it back into your cloak he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak and when he took it out it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
Then the Lord said If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign they may believe the second.
But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.
Moses said to the Lord O Lord I have never been eloquent neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.
The Lord said to him Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I the Lord?
Now go I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.
But Moses said O Lord please send someone else to do it.
Then the Lords anger burned against Moses and he said What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you and his heart will be glad when he sees you.
You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.
He will speak to the people for you and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.
But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it.
Then Moses went back to Jethro his fatherinlaw and said to him Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive. Jethro said Go and I wish you well.
Now the Lord had said to Moses in Midian Go back to Egypt for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead.
So Moses took his wife and sons put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.
The Lord said to Moses When you return to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
Then say to Pharaoh This is what the Lord says Israel is my firstborn son
and I told you Let my son go so he may worship me. But you refused to let him go so I will kill your firstborn son. 
At a lodging place on the way the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him.
But Zipporah took a flint knife cut off her sons foreskin and touched Moses feet with it. Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me she said.
So the Lord let him alone.
The Lord said to Aaron Go into the desert to meet Moses. So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.
Then Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.
Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites
and Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people
and they believed. And when they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery they bowed down and worshiped.
Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Let my people go so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert. 
Pharaoh said Who is the Lord that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go.
Then they said The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a threeday journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.
But the king of Egypt said Moses and Aaron why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!
Then Pharaoh said Look the people of the land are now numerous and you are stopping them from working.
That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people
You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks let them go and gather their own straw.
But require them to make the same number of bricks as before dont reduce the quota. They are lazy that is why they are crying out Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.
Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people This is what Pharaoh says I will not give you any more straw.
Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it but your work will not be reduced at all. 
So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.
The slave drivers kept pressing them saying Complete the work required of you for each day just as when you had straw.
The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaohs slave drivers were beaten and were asked Why didnt you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today as before?
Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh Why have you treated your servants this way?
Your servants are given no straw yet we are told Make bricks! Your servants are being beaten but the fault is with your own people.
Pharaoh said Lazy thats what you arelazy! That is why you keep saying Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.
Now get to work. You will not be given any straw yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.
The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.
When they left Pharaoh they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them
and they said May the Lord look upon you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.
Moses returned to the Lord and said O Lord why have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me?
Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name he has brought trouble upon this people and you have not rescued your people at all.
Then the Lord said to Moses Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh Because of my mighty hand he will let them go because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.
God also said to Moses I am the Lord.
I appeared to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty but by my name the Lord I did not make myself known to them.
I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan where they lived as aliens.
Moreover I have heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians are enslaving and I have remembered my covenant.
Therefore say to the Israelites I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
I will take you as my own people and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the Lord. 
Moses reported this to the Israelites but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Go tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.
But Moses said to the Lord If the Israelites will not listen to me why would Pharaoh listen to me since I speak with faltering lips?
Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
These were the heads of their families The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
The sons of Simeon were Jemuel Jamin Ohad Jakin Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records Gershon Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
The sons of Gershon by clans were Libni and Shimei.
The sons of Kohath were Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.
Amram married his fathers sister Jochebed who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
The sons of Izhar were Korah Nepheg and Zicri.
The sons of Uzziel were Mishael Elzaphan and Sithri.
Aaron married Elisheba daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon and she bore him Nadab and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar.
The sons of Korah were Assir Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families clan by clan.
It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.
Now when the Lord spoke to Moses in Egypt
he said to him I am the Lord. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.
But Moses said to the Lord Since I speak with faltering lips why would Pharaoh listen to me?
Then the Lord said to Moses See I have made you like God to Pharaoh and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
You are to say everything I command you and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.
But I will harden Pharaohs heart and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt
he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions my people the Israelites.
And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it.
Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them.
Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eightythree when they spoke to Pharaoh.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron
When Pharaoh says to you Perform a miracle then say to Aaron Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh and it will become a snake.
So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials and it became a snake.
Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts
Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aarons staff swallowed up their staffs.
Yet Pharaohs heart became hard and he would not listen to them just as the Lord had said.
Then the Lord said to Moses Pharaohs heart is unyielding he refuses to let the people go.
Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water. Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.
Then say to him The Lord the God of the Hebrews has sent me to say to you Let my people go so that they may worship me in the desert. But until now you have not listened.
This is what the Lord says By this you will know that I am the Lord With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile and it will be changed into blood.
The fish in the Nile will die and the river will stink the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water. 
The Lord said to Moses Tell Aaron Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egyptover the streams and canals over the ponds and all the reservoirsand they will turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt even in the wooden buckets and stone jars.
Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile and all the water was changed into blood.
The fish in the Nile died and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts and Pharaohs heart became hard he would not listen to Moses and Aaron just as the Lord had said.
Instead he turned and went into his palace and did not take even this to heart.
And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water because they could not drink the water of the river.
Seven days passed after the Lord struck the Nile.
Then the Lord said to Moses Go to Pharaoh and say to him This is what the Lord says Let my people go so that they may worship me.
If you refuse to let them go I will plague your whole country with frogs.
The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed into the houses of your officials and on your people and into your ovens and kneading troughs.
The frogs will go up on you and your people and all your officials. 
Then the Lord said to Moses Tell Aaron Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt. 
So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land.
But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.
Moses said to Pharaoh I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs except for those that remain in the Nile.
Tomorrow Pharaoh said. Moses replied It will be as you say so that you may know there is no one like the Lord our God.
The frogs will leave you and your houses your officials and your people they will remain only in the Nile.
After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
And the Lord did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses in the courtyards and in the fields.
They were piled into heaps and the land reeked of them.
But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron just as the Lord had said.
Then the Lord said to Moses Tell Aaron Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.
They did this and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground gnats came upon men and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.
But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts they could not. And the gnats were on men and animals.
The magicians said to Pharaoh This is the finger of God. But Pharaohs heart was hard and he would not listen just as the Lord had said.
Then the Lord said to Moses Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to him This is what the Lord says Let my people go so that they may worship me.
If you do not let my people go I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies and even the ground where they are.
 But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen where my people live no swarms of flies will be there so that you will know that I the Lord am in this land.
I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This miraculous sign will occur tomorrow. 
And the Lord did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaohs palace and into the houses of his officials and throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.
Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said Go sacrifice to your God here in the land.
But Moses said That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the Lord our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes will they not stone us?
We must take a threeday journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God as he commands us.
Pharaoh said I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the desert but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.
Moses answered As soon as I leave you I will pray to the Lord and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only be sure that Pharaoh does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.
Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord
and the Lord did what Moses asked The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people not a fly remained.
But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
Then the Lord said to Moses Go to Pharaoh and say to him This is what the Lord the God of the Hebrews says Let my people go so that they may worship me.
If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back
the hand of the Lord will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the fieldon your horses and donkeys and camels and on your cattle and sheep and goats.
But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die. 
The Lord set a time and said Tomorrow the Lord will do this in the land.
And the next day the Lord did it All the livestock of the Egyptians died but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.
Pharaoh sent men to investigate and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.
Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.
It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt and festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land.
So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air and festering boils broke out on men and animals.
The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.
But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron just as the Lord had said to Moses.
Then the Lord said to Moses Get up early in the morning confront Pharaoh and say to him This is what the Lord the God of the Hebrews says Let my people go so that they may worship me
or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
But I have raised you up for this very purpose that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
Therefore at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt from the day it was founded till now.
Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter because the hail will fall on every man and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field and they will die. 
Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the Lord hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.
But those who ignored the word of the Lord left their slaves and livestock in the field.
Then the Lord said to Moses Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypton men and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.
When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky the Lord sent thunder and hail and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt
hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fieldsboth men and animals it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen where the Israelites were.
Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. This time I have sinned he said to them. The Lord is in the right and I and my people are in the wrong.
Pray to the Lord for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go you dont have to stay any longer.
Moses replied When I have gone out of the city I will spread out my hands in prayer to the Lord. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail so you may know that the earth is the Lords.
But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the Lord God.
(The flax and barley were destroyed since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
The wheat and spelt however were not destroyed because they ripen later.)
Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the Lord the thunder and hail stopped and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped he sinned again He and his officials hardened their hearts.
So Pharaohs heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go just as the Lord had said through Moses.
Then the Lord said to Moses Go to Pharaoh for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these miraculous signs of mine among them
that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them and that you may know that I am the Lord.
So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him This is what the Lord the God of the Hebrews says How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go so that they may worship me.
If you refuse to let them go I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.
They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail including every tree that is growing in your fields.
They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptianssomething neither your fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.  Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
Pharaohs officials said to him How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go so that they may worship the Lord their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?
Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. Go worship the Lord your God he said. But just who will be going?
Moses answered We will go with our young and old with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds because we are to celebrate a festival to the Lord.
Pharaoh said The Lord be with youif I let you go along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.
No! Have only the men go and worship the Lord since thats what you have been asking for. Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaohs presence.
And the Lord said to Moses Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields everything left by the hail.
So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt and the Lord made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts
they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts nor will there ever be again.
They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the haileverything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you.
Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the Lord your God to take this deadly plague away from me.
Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord.
And the Lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart and he would not let the Israelites go.
Then the Lord said to Moses Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness will spread over Egyptdarkness that can be felt.
So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.
No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said Go worship the Lord. Even your women and children may go with you only leave your flocks and herds behind.
But Moses said You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the Lord our God.
Our livestock too must go with us not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the Lord our God and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the Lord.
But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart and he was not willing to let them go.
Pharaoh said to Moses Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.
Just as you say Moses replied I will never appear before you again.
Now the Lord had said to Moses I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that he will let you go from here and when he does he will drive you out completely.
Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.

So Moses said This is what the Lord says About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.
Every firstborn son in Egypt will die from the firstborn son of Pharaoh who sits on the throne to the firstborn son of the slave girl who is at her hand mill and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
There will be loud wailing throughout Egyptworse than there has ever been or ever will be again.
But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal. Then you will know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
All these officials of yours will come to me bowing down before me and saying Go you and all the people who follow you! After that I will leave. Then Moses hot with anger left Pharaoh.
The Lord had said to Moses Pharaoh will refuse to listen to youso that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.
Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh but the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt
This month is to be for you the first month the first month of your year.
Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family one for each household.
If any household is too small for a whole lamb they must share one with their nearest neighbor having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.
The animals you choose must be yearold males without defect and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.
Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.
Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.
That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire along with bitter herbs and bread made without yeast.
Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water but roast it over the firehead legs and inner parts.
Do not leave any of it till morning if some is left till morning you must burn it.
This is how you are to eat it with your cloak tucked into your belt your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste it is the Lords Passover.
On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstbornboth men and animalsand I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord.
The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
This is a day you are to commemorate for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lorda lasting ordinance.
For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.
On the first day hold a sacred assembly and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days except to prepare food for everyone to eatthat is all you may do.
Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twentyfirst day.
For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel whether he is an alien or nativeborn.
Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live you must eat unleavened bread.
Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.
Take a bunch of hyssop dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning.
When the Lord goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.
Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.
When you enter the land that the Lord will give you as he promised observe this ceremony.
And when your children ask you What does this ceremony mean to you?
then tell them It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.  Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
The Israelites did just what the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron.
At midnight the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on the throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.
Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night and there was loud wailing in Egypt for there was not a house without someone dead.
During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said Up! Leave my people you and the Israelites! Go worship the Lord as you have requested.
Take your flocks and herds as you have said and go. And also bless me.
The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. For otherwise they said we will all die!
So the people took their dough before the yeast was added and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.
The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.
The Lord had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people and they gave them what they asked for so they plundered the Egyptians.
The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot besides women and children.
Many other people went up with them as well as large droves of livestock both flocks and herds.
With the dough they had brought from Egypt they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.
Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.
At the end of the 430 years to the very day all the Lords divisions left Egypt.
Because the Lord kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the Lord for the generations to come.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron These are the regulations for the Passover No foreigner is to eat of it.
Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him
but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it.
It must be eaten inside one house take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.
The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the Lords Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.
The same law applies to the nativeborn and to the alien living among you.
All the Israelites did just what the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
And on that very day the Lord brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
The Lord said to Moses
Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me whether man or animal.
Then Moses said to the people Commemorate this day the day you came out of Egypt out of the land of slavery because the Lord brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.
Today in the month of Abib you are leaving.
When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites Hittites Amorites Hivites and Jebusitesthe land he swore to your forefathers to give you a land flowing with milk and honeyyou are to observe this ceremony in this month
For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the Lord.
Eat unleavened bread during those seven days nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.
On that day tell your son I do this because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.
This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the Lord is to be on your lips. For the Lord brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
After the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you as he promised on oath to you and your forefathers
you are to give over to the Lord the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the Lord.
Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey but if you do not redeem it break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.
In days to come when your son asks you What does this mean? say to him With a mighty hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go the Lord killed every firstborn in Egypt both man and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the Lord the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.
And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the Lord brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
When Pharaoh let the people go God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country though that was shorter. For God said If they face war they might change their minds and return to Egypt.
So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for battle.
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He had said God will surely come to your aid and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.
After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
By day the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they could travel by day or night.
Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea directly opposite Baal Zephon.
Pharaoh will think The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion hemmed in by the desert.
And I will harden Pharaohs heart and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. So the Israelites did this.
When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!
So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.
He took six hundred of the best chariots along with all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt so that he pursued the Israelites who were marching out boldly.
The Egyptiansall Pharaohs horses and chariots horsemen and troopspursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth opposite Baal Zephon.
As Pharaoh approached the Israelites looked up and there were the Egyptians marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the Lord.
They said to Moses Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
Didnt we say to you in Egypt Leave us alone let us serve the Egyptians? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!
Moses answered the people Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.
The Lord will fight for you you need only to be still.
Then the Lord said to Moses Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.
Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army through his chariots and his horsemen.
The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I gain glory through Pharaoh his chariots and his horsemen.
Then the angel of God who had been traveling in front of Israels army withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them
coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side so neither went near the other all night long.
Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided
and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
The Egyptians pursued them and all Pharaohs horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.
During the last watch of the night the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.
He made the wheels of their chariots come off so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said Lets get away from the Israelites! The Lord is fighting for them against Egypt.
Then the Lord said to Moses Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it and the Lord swept them into the sea.
The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsementhe entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
That day the Lord saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
And when the Israelites saw the great power the Lord displayed against the Egyptians the people feared the Lord and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.
Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord I will sing to the Lord for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.
The Lord is my strength and my song he has become my salvation. He is my God and I will praise him my fathers God and I will exalt him.
The Lord is a warrior the Lord is his name.
Pharaohs chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaohs officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
The deep waters have covered them they sank to the depths like a stone.
Your right hand O Lord was majestic in power. Your right hand O Lord shattered the enemy.
In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger it consumed them like stubble.
By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood firm like a wall the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
The enemy boasted I will pursue I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.
But you blew with your breath and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
Who among the gods is like you O Lord? Who is like you majestic in holiness awesome in glory working wonders?
You stretched out your right hand and the earth swallowed them.
In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling.
The nations will hear and tremble anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
The chiefs of Edom will be terrified the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling the people of Canaan will melt away
terror and dread will fall upon them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone until your people pass by O Lord until the people you bought pass by.
You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance the place O Lord you made for your dwelling the sanctuary O Lord your hands established.
The Lord will reign for ever and ever.
When Pharaohs horses chariots and horsemen went into the sea the Lord brought the waters of the sea back over them but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
Then Miriam the prophetess Aarons sister took a tambourine in her hand and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
Miriam sang to them Sing to the Lord for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.
Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
When they came to Marah they could not drink its water because it was bitter.
So the people grumbled against Moses saying What are we to drink?
Then Moses cried out to the Lord and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water and the water became sweet. There the Lord made a decree and a law for them and there he tested them.
He said If you listen carefully to the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in his eyes if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians for I am the Lord who heals you.
Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees and they camped there near the water.
The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin which is between Elim and Sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
The Israelites said to them If only we had died by the Lords hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.
Then the Lord said to Moses I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.
On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.
So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites In the evening you will know that it was the Lord who brought you out of Egypt
and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we that you should grumble against us?
Moses also said You will know that it was the Lord when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us but against the Lord.
Then Moses told Aaron Say to the entire Israelite community Come before the Lord for he has heard your grumbling. 
While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community they looked toward the desert and there was the glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud.
The Lord said to Moses
I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them At twilight you will eat meat and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God. 
That evening quail came and covered the camp and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
When the dew was gone thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.
When the Israelites saw it they said to each other What is it? For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them It is the bread the Lord has given you to eat.
This is what the Lord has commanded Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent. 
The Israelites did as they were told some gathered much some little.
And when they measured it by the omer he who gathered much did not have too much and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered as much as he needed.
Then Moses said to them No one is to keep any of it until morning.
However some of them paid no attention to Moses they kept part of it until morning but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed and when the sun grew hot it melted away.
On the sixth day they gathered twice as muchtwo omers for each personand the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.
He said to them This is what the Lord commanded Tomorrow is to be a day of rest a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning. 
So they saved it until morning as Moses commanded and it did not stink or get maggots in it.
Eat it today Moses said because today is a Sabbath to the Lord. You will not find any of it on the ground today.
Six days you are to gather it but on the seventh day the Sabbath there will not be any.
Nevertheless some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it but they found none.
Then the Lord said to Moses How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?
Bear in mind that the Lord has given you the Sabbath that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day no one is to go out.
So the people rested on the seventh day.
The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
Moses said This is what the Lord has commanded Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt. 
So Moses said to Aaron Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the Lord to be kept for the generations to come.
As the Lord commanded Moses Aaron put the manna in front of the Testimony that it might be kept.
The Israelites ate manna forty years until they came to a land that was settled they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.

The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded. They camped at Rephidim but there was no water for the people to drink.
So they quarreled with Moses and said Give us water to drink. Moses replied Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the Lord to the test?
But the people were thirsty for water there and they grumbled against Moses. They said Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?
Then Moses cried out to the Lord What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.
The Lord answered Moses Walk on ahead of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile and go.
I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock and water will come out of it for the people to drink. So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the Lord saying Is the Lord among us or not?
The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
Moses said to Joshua Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.
So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered and Moses Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.
As long as Moses held up his hands the Israelites were winning but whenever he lowered his hands the Amalekites were winning.
When Moses hands grew tired they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands upone on one side one on the otherso that his hands remained steady till sunset.
So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.
Then the Lord said to Moses Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.
Moses built an altar and called it The Lord is my Banner.
He said For hands were lifted up to the throne of the Lord. The Lord will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.
Now Jethro the priest of Midian and fatherinlaw of Moses heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel and how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.
After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah his fatherinlaw Jethro received her
and her two sons. One son was named Gershom for Moses said I have become an alien in a foreign land
and the other was named Eliezer for he said My fathers God was my helper he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.
Jethro Moses fatherinlaw together with Moses sons and wife came to him in the desert where he was camped near the mountain of God.
Jethro had sent word to him I your fatherinlaw Jethro am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.
So Moses went out to meet his fatherinlaw and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.
Moses told his fatherinlaw about everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israels sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the Lord had saved them.
Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the Lord had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.
He said Praise be to the Lord who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
Now I know that the Lord is greater than all other gods for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.
Then Jethro Moses fatherinlaw brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses fatherinlaw in the presence of God.
The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people and they stood around him from morning till evening.
When his fatherinlaw saw all that Moses was doing for the people he said What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?
Moses answered him Because the people come to me to seek Gods will.
Whenever they have a dispute it is brought to me and I decide between the parties and inform them of Gods decrees and laws.
Moses fatherinlaw replied What you are doing is not good.
You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you you cannot handle it alone.
Listen now to me and I will give you some advice and may God be with you. You must be the peoples representative before God and bring their disputes to him.
Teach them the decrees and laws and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform.
But select capable men from all the peoplemen who fear God trustworthy men who hate dishonest gainand appoint them as officials over thousands hundreds fifties and tens.
Have them serve as judges for the people at all times but have them bring every difficult case to you the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter because they will share it with you.
If you do this and God so commands you will be able to stand the strain and all these people will go home satisfied.
Moses listened to his fatherinlaw and did everything he said.
He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people officials over thousands hundreds fifties and tens.
They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses but the simple ones they decided themselves.
Then Moses sent his fatherinlaw on his way and Jethro returned to his own country.
Then Moses went up to God and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel
You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried you on eagles wings and brought you to myself.
Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine
you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.
So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the Lord had commanded him to speak.
The people all responded together We will do everything the Lord has said. So Moses brought their answer back to the Lord.
The Lord said to Moses I am going to come to you in a dense cloud so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you. Then Moses told the Lord what the people had said.
And the Lord said to Moses Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
and be ready by the third day because on that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
He shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows not a hand is to be laid on him. Whether man or animal he shall not be permitted to live. Only when the rams horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain.
After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people he consecrated them and they washed their clothes.
Then he said to the people Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.
On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning with a thick cloud over the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.
Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace the whole mountain trembled violently
and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.
The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up
and the Lord said to him Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the Lord and many of them perish.
Even the priests who approach the Lord must consecrate themselves or the Lord will break out against them.
Moses said to the Lord The people cannot come up Mount Sinai because you yourself warned us Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy. 
The Lord replied Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the Lord or he will break out against them.
So Moses went down to the people and told them.
And God spoke all these words
I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
You shall have no other gods before me.
You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
You shall not bow down to them or worship them for I the Lord your God am a jealous God punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me
but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
Six days you shall labor and do all your work
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work neither you nor your son or daughter nor your manservant or maidservant nor your animals nor the alien within your gates.
For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
Honor your father and your mother so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
You shall not murder.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbors house. You shall not covet your neighbors wife or his manservant or maidservant his ox or donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance
and said to Moses Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.
Moses said to the people Do not be afraid. God has come to test you so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.
The people remained at a distance while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
Then the Lord said to Moses Tell the Israelites this You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven
Do not make any gods to be alongside me do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.
 Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored I will come to you and bless you.
If you make an altar of stones for me do not build it with dressed stones for you will defile it if you use a tool on it.
And do not go up to my altar on steps lest your nakedness be exposed on it.
These are the laws you are to set before them
If you buy a Hebrew servant he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year he shall go free without paying anything.
If he comes alone he is to go free alone but if he has a wife when he comes she is to go with him.
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters the woman and her children shall belong to her master and only the man shall go free.
But if the servant declares I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free
then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.
If a man sells his daughter as a servant she is not to go free as menservants do.
If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners because he has broken faith with her.
If he selects her for his son he must grant her the rights of a daughter.
If he marries another woman he must not deprive the first one of her food clothing and marital rights.
If he does not provide her with these three things she is to go free without any payment of money.
Anyone who strikes a man and kills him shall surely be put to death.
However if he does not do it intentionally but God lets it happen he is to flee to a place I will designate.
But if a man schemes and kills another man deliberately take him away from my altar and put him to death.
Anyone who attacks his father or his mother must be put to death.
Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death.
Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.
If men quarrel and one hits the other with a stone or with his fist and he does not die but is confined to bed
the one who struck the blow will not be held responsible if the other gets up and walks around outside with his staff however he must pay the injured man for the loss of his time and see that he is completely healed.
If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result he must be punished
but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two since the slave is his property.
If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury the offender must be fined whatever the womans husband demands and the court allows.
But if there is serious injury you are to take life for life
eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise.
If a man hits a manservant or maidservant in the eye and destroys it he must let the servant go free to compensate for the eye.
And if he knocks out the tooth of a manservant or maidservant he must let the servant go free to compensate for the tooth.
If a bull gores a man or a woman to death the bull must be stoned to death and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held responsible.
If however the bull has had the habit of goring and the owner has been warned but has not kept it penned up and it kills a man or woman the bull must be stoned and the owner also must be put to death.
However if payment is demanded of him he may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded.
This law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter.
If the bull gores a male or female slave the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave and the bull must be stoned.
If a man uncovers a pit or digs one and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it
the owner of the pit must pay for the loss he must pay its owner and the dead animal will be his.
If a mans bull injures the bull of another and it dies they are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal equally.
However if it was known that the bull had the habit of goring yet the owner did not keep it penned up the owner must pay animal for animal and the dead animal will be his.
If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it he must pay back five head of cattle for the ox and four sheep for the sheep.
If a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and lets them stray and they graze in another mans field he must make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard.
If a fire breaks out and spreads into thornbushes so that it burns shocks of grain or standing grain or the whole field the one who started the fire must make restitution.
If a man gives his neighbor silver or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbors house the thief if he is caught must pay back double.
But if the thief is not found the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether he has laid his hands on the other mans property.
In all cases of illegal possession of an ox a donkey a sheep a garment or any other lost property about which somebody says This is mine both parties are to bring their cases before the judges. The one whom the judges declare guilty must pay back double to his neighbor.
If a man gives a donkey an ox a sheep or any other animal to his neighbor for safekeeping and it dies or is injured or is taken away while no one is looking
the issue between them will be settled by the taking of an oath before the Lord that the neighbor did not lay hands on the other persons property. The owner is to accept this and no restitution is required.
But if the animal was stolen from the neighbor he must make restitution to the owner.
If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal he shall bring in the remains as evidence and he will not be required to pay for the torn animal.
If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present he must make restitution.
But if the owner is with the animal the borrower will not have to pay. If the animal was hired the money paid for the hire covers the loss.
If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her he must pay the brideprice and she shall be his wife.
If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him he must still pay the brideprice for virgins.
Do not allow a sorceress to live.
Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must be put to death.
Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the Lord must be destroyed.
Do not mistreat an alien or oppress him for you were aliens in Egypt.
Do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan.
If you do and they cry out to me I will certainly hear their cry.
My anger will be aroused and I will kill you with the sword your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.
If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy do not be like a moneylender charge him no interest.
If you take your neighbors cloak as a pledge return it to him by sunset
because his cloak is the only covering he has for his body. What else will he sleep in? When he cries out to me I will hear for I am compassionate.
Do not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people.
Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats. You must give me the firstborn of your sons.
Do the same with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days but give them to me on the eighth day.
You are to be my holy people. So do not eat the meat of an animal torn by wild beasts throw it to the dogs.
Do not spread false reports. Do not help a wicked man by being a malicious witness.
Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd
and do not show favoritism to a poor man in his lawsuit.
If you come across your enemys ox or donkey wandering off be sure to take it back to him.
If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load do not leave it there be sure you help him with it.
Do not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent or honest person to death for I will not acquit the guilty.
Do not accept a bribe for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous.
Do not oppress an alien you yourselves know how it feels to be aliens because you were aliens in Egypt.
For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops
but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it and the wild animals may eat what they leave. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
Six days do your work but on the seventh day do not work so that your ox and your donkey may rest and the slave born in your household and the alien as well may be refreshed.
Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods do not let them be heard on your lips.
Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me.
Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days eat bread made without yeast as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib for in that month you came out of Egypt. No one is to appear before me emptyhanded.
Celebrate the Feast of Harvest with the firstfruits of the crops you sow in your field. Celebrate the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in your crops from the field.
Three times a year all the men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord.
Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast. The fat of my festival offerings must not be kept until morning.
Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mothers milk.
See I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared.
Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him he will not forgive your rebellion since my Name is in him.
If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.
My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites Hittites Perizzites Canaanites Hivites and Jebusites and I will wipe them out.
Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces.
Worship the Lord your God and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you
and none will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full life span.
I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.
I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites Canaanites and Hittites out of your way.
But I will not drive them out in a single year because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.
Little by little I will drive them out before you until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.
I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines and from the desert to the River. I will hand over to you the people who live in the land and you will drive them out before you.
Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.
Do not let them live in your land or they will cause you to sin against me because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you.
Then he said to Moses Come up to the Lord you and Aaron Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel. You are to worship at a distance
but Moses alone is to approach the Lord the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him.
When Moses went and told the people all the Lords words and laws they responded with one voice Everything the Lord has said we will do.
Moses then wrote down everything the Lord had said. He got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
Then he sent young Israelite men and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the Lord.
Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls and the other half he sprinkled on the altar.
Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded We will do everything the Lord has said we will obey.
Moses then took the blood sprinkled it on the people and said This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.
Moses and Aaron Nadab and Abihu and the seventy elders of Israel went up
and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire clear as the sky itself.
But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites they saw God and they ate and drank.
The Lord said to Moses Come up to me on the mountain and stay here and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commands I have written for their instruction.
Then Moses set out with Joshua his aide and Moses went up on the mountain of God.

Then the Lord said to Moses
When you take a census of the Israelites to count them each one must pay the Lord a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on them when you number them.
Each one who crosses over to those already counted is to give a half shekel according to the sanctuary shekel which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the Lord.
All who cross over those twenty years old or more are to give an offering to the Lord.
The rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less when you make the offering to the Lord to atone for your lives.
Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord making atonement for your lives.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Make a bronze basin with its bronze stand for washing. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.

500 shekels of cassiaall according to the sanctuary shekeland a hin of olive oil.

You shall consecrate them so they will be most holy and whatever touches them will be holy.
Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve me as priests.
Say to the Israelites This is to be my sacred anointing oil for the generations to come.
Do not pour it on mens bodies and do not make any oil with the same formula. It is sacred and you are to consider it sacred.
Whoever makes perfume like it and whoever puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from his people. 
Then the Lord said to Moses Take fragrant spicesgum resin onycha and galbanumand pure frankincense all in equal amounts
and make a fragrant blend of incense the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred.
Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.
Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves consider it holy to the Lord.
Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from his people.
Then the Lord said to Moses
See I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah
and I have filled him with the Spirit of God with skill ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts
to make artistic designs for work in gold silver and bronze
to cut and set stones to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship.
Moreover I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan to help him. Also I have given skill to all the craftsmen to make everything I have commanded you
the Tent of Meeting the ark of the Testimony with the atonement cover on it and all the other furnishings of the tent
the table and its articles the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories the altar of incense
the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils the basin with its stand
and also the woven garments both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests
and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Say to the Israelites You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come so you may know that I am the Lord who makes you holy.
 Observe the Sabbath because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from his people.
For six days work is to be done but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.
The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.
It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested. 
When the Lord finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai he gave him the two tablets of the Testimony the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain they gathered around Aaron and said Come make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt we dont know what has happened to him.
Aaron answered them Take off the gold earrings that your wives your sons and your daughters are wearing and bring them to me.
So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.
He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf fashioning it with a tool. Then they said These are your gods O Israel who brought you up out of Egypt.
When Aaron saw this he built an altar in front of the calf and announced Tomorrow there will be a festival to the Lord.
So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
Then the Lord said to Moses Go down because your people whom you brought up out of Egypt have become corrupt.
They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said These are your gods O Israel who brought you up out of Egypt.
I have seen these people the Lord said to Moses and they are a stiffnecked people.
Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.
But Moses sought the favor of the Lord his God. O Lord he said why should your anger burn against your people whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
Why should the Egyptians say It was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce anger relent and do not bring disaster on your people.
Remember your servants Abraham Isaac and Israel to whom you swore by your own self I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them and it will be their inheritance forever. 
Then the Lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides front and back.
The tablets were the work of God the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets.
When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting he said to Moses There is the sound of war in the camp.
Moses replied It is not the sound of victory it is not the sound of defeat it is the sound of singing that I hear.
When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.
And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire then he ground it to powder scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.
He said to Aaron What did these people do to you that you led them into such great sin?
Do not be angry my lord Aaron answered. You know how prone these people are to evil.
They said to me Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt we dont know what has happened to him.
So I told them Whoever has any gold jewelry take it off. Then they gave me the gold and I threw it into the fire and out came this calf!
Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.
So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said Whoever is for the Lord come to me. And all the Levites rallied to him.
Then he said to them This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other each killing his brother and friend and neighbor. 
The Levites did as Moses commanded and that day about three thousand of the people died.
Then Moses said You have been set apart to the Lord today for you were against your own sons and brothers and he has blessed you this day.
The next day Moses said to the people You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the Lord perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.
So Moses went back to the Lord and said Oh what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.
But now please forgive their sinbut if not then blot me out of the book you have written.
The Lord replied to Moses Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.
Now go lead the people to the place I spoke of and my angel will go before you. However when the time comes for me to punish I will punish them for their sin.
And the Lord struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
Then the Lord said to Moses Leave this place you and the people you brought up out of Egypt and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob saying I will give it to your descendants.
I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites Amorites Hittites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites.
Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you because you are a stiffnecked people and I might destroy you on the way.
When the people heard these distressing words they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.
For the Lord had said to Moses Tell the Israelites You are a stiffnecked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you. 
So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away calling it the tent of meeting. Anyone inquiring of the Lord would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.
And whenever Moses went out to the tent all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents watching Moses until he entered the tent.
As Moses went into the tent the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses.
Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent they all stood and worshiped each at the entrance to his tent.
The Lord would speak to Moses face to face as a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.
Moses said to the Lord You have been telling me Lead these people but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said I know you by name and you have found favor with me.
If you are pleased with me teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people.
The Lord replied My Presence will go with you and I will give you rest.
Then Moses said to him If your Presence does not go with us do not send us up from here.
How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?
And the Lord said to Moses I will do the very thing you have asked because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.
Then Moses said Now show me your glory.
And the Lord said I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you and I will proclaim my name the Lord in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
But he said you cannot see my face for no one may see me and live.
Then the Lord said There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.
When my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back but my face must not be seen.
The Lord said to Moses Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets which you broke.
Be ready in the morning and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.
No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.
So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning as the Lord had commanded him and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.
Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name the Lord.
And he passed in front of Moses proclaiming The Lord the Lord the compassionate and gracious God slow to anger abounding in love and faithfulness
maintaining love to thousands and forgiving wickedness rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.
Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.
O Lord if I have found favor in your eyes he said then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiffnecked people forgive our wickedness and our sin and take us as your inheritance.
Then the Lord said I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I the Lord will do for you.
Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites Canaanites Hittites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites.
Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going or they will be a snare among you.
Break down their altars smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.
Do not worship any other god for the Lord whose name is Jealous is a jealous God.
Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.
And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods they will lead your sons to do the same.
Do not make cast idols.
Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib for in that month you came out of Egypt.
The first offspring of every womb belongs to me including all the firstborn males of your livestock whether from herd or flock.
Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb but if you do not redeem it break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. No one is to appear before me emptyhanded.
Six days you shall labor but on the seventh day you shall rest even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.
Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord the God of Israel.
I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the Lord your God.
Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mothers milk.
Then the Lord said to Moses Write down these words for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenantthe Ten Commandments.
When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord.
When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses his face was radiant and they were afraid to come near him.
But Moses called to them so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him and he spoke to them.
Afterward all the Israelites came near him and he gave them all the commands the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.
When Moses finished speaking to them he put a veil over his face.
But whenever he entered the Lords presence to speak with him he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded
they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the Lord.
Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them These are the things the Lord has commanded you to do
For six days work is to be done but the seventh day shall be your holy day a Sabbath of rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death.
Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.
Moses said to the whole Israelite community This is what the Lord has commanded
From what you have take an offering for the Lord. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the Lord an offering of gold silver and bronze
blue purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen goat hair
ram skins dyed red and hides of sea cows acacia wood
olive oil for the light spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense
and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the Lord has commanded
the tabernacle with its tent and its covering clasps frames crossbars posts and bases

Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses presence
and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the Lord for the work on the Tent of Meeting for all its service and for the sacred garments.
All who were willing men and women alike came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds brooches earrings rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the Lord.
Everyone who had blue purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen or goat hair ram skins dyed red or hides of sea cows brought them.
Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the Lord and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.
Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spunblue purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen.
And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair.
The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the Lord freewill offerings for all the work the Lord through Moses had commanded them to do.
Then Moses said to the Israelites See the Lord has chosen Bezalel son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah
and he has filled him with the Spirit of God with skill ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts
to make artistic designs for work in gold silver and bronze
to cut and set stones to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic craftsmanship.
And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan the ability to teach others.
He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as craftsmen designers embroiderers in blue purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen and weaversall of them master craftsmen and designers.
So Bezalel Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the Lord has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the Lord has commanded.
Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the Lord had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work.
They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
So all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their work
and said to Moses The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the Lord commanded to be done.
Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary. And so the people were restrained from bringing more
because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.
All the skilled men among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue purple and scarlet yarn with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman.
All the curtains were the same sizetwentyeight cubits long and four cubits wide.
They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.

They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacleeleven altogether.
All eleven curtains were the same sizethirty cubits long and four cubits wide.

Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.
Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red and over that a covering of hides of sea cows.
They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide
with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle

And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
He made the atonement cover of pure goldtwo and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover.
The cherubim had their wings spread upward overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other looking toward the cover.
They made the table of acacia woodtwo cubits long a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high.
Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.
They also made around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners where the four legs were.
The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.

Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.
They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephodas the Lord commanded Moses.
They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloththe work of a weaver

The Israelites had done all the work just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the Lord had commanded. So Moses blessed them.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Set up the tabernacle the Tent of Meeting on the first day of the first month.
Place the ark of the Testimony in it and shield the ark with the curtain.
Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.

Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.
Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it consecrate it and all its furnishings and it will be holy.
Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils consecrate the altar and it will be most holy.
Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.
Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.
Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest.
Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
Anoint them just as you anointed their father so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come.
Moses did everything just as the Lord commanded him.
So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.
When Moses set up the tabernacle he put the bases in place erected the frames inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.
Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent as the Lord commanded him.
He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.
Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony as the Lord commanded him.
Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain
and set out the bread on it before the Lord as the Lord commanded him.
He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
and set up the lamps before the Lord as the Lord commanded him.
Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain
and burned fragrant incense on it as the Lord commanded him.
Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle the Tent of Meeting and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings as the Lord commanded him.
He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing
and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.
They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar as the Lord commanded Moses.
Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.
Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
In all the travels of the Israelites whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle they would set out
but if the cloud did not lift they did not set outuntil the day it lifted.
So the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day and fire was in the cloud by night in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels.
The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting. He said
Speak to the Israelites and say to them When any of you brings an offering to the Lord bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.
 If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd he is to offer a male without defect. He must present it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting so that it will be acceptable to the Lord.

The Lord said to Moses
Say to the Israelites When anyone sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lords commands
 If the anointed priest sins bringing guilt on the people he must bring to the Lord a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.
He is to present the bull at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the Lord. He is to lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the Lord.
Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bulls blood and carry it into the Tent of Meeting.

But the hide of the bull and all its flesh as well as the head and legs the inner parts and offal
that is all the rest of the bullhe must take outside the camp to a place ceremonially clean where the ashes are thrown and burn it in a wood fire on the ash heap.
 If the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lords commands even though the community is unaware of the matter they are guilty.
When they become aware of the sin they committed the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting.
The elders of the community are to lay their hands on the bulls head before the Lord and the bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord.

Every grain offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who offers it

 These are the regulations for the fellowship offering a person may present to the Lord

Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which an offering by fire may be made to the Lord must be cut off from his people.

You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.
The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his share.
From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their regular share from the Israelites. 
This is the portion of the offerings made to the Lord by fire that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the Lord as priests.
On the day they were anointed the Lord commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their regular share for the generations to come.
These then are the regulations for the burnt offering the grain offering the sin offering the guilt offering the ordination offering and the fellowship offering
which the Lord gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord in the Desert of Sinai.
The Lord said to Moses
Bring Aaron and his sons their garments the anointing oil the bull for the sin offering the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast
and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
Moses did as the Lord commanded him and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
Moses said to the assembly This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.
Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
He put the tunic on Aaron tied the sash around him clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also tied the ephod to him by its skillfully woven waistband so it was fastened on him.
He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
Then he placed the turban on Aarons head and set the gold plate the sacred diadem on the front of it as the Lord commanded Moses.
Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it and so consecrated them.
He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand to consecrate them.
He poured some of the anointing oil on Aarons head and anointed him to consecrate him.
Then he brought Aarons sons forward put tunics on them tied sashes around them and put headbands on them as the Lord commanded Moses.
He then presented the bull for the sin offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it.
Moses also took all the fat around the inner parts the covering of the liver and both kidneys and their fat and burned it on the altar.
But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its offal he burned up outside the camp as the Lord commanded Moses.
He then presented the ram for the burnt offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
Then Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled the blood against the altar on all sides.
He then presented the other ram the ram for the ordination and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aarons right ear on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Moses also brought Aarons sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he sprinkled blood against the altar on all sides.
He took the fat the fat tail all the fat around the inner parts the covering of the liver both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
Then from the basket of bread made without yeast which was before the Lord he took a cake of bread and one made with oil and a wafer he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the Lord as a wave offering.
Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering a pleasing aroma an offering made to the Lord by fire.
He also took the breastMoses share of the ordination ramand waved it before the Lord as a wave offering as the Lord commanded Moses.
Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.
Moses then said to Aaron and his sons Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings as I commanded saying Aaron and his sons are to eat it.
Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread.
Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days until the days of your ordination are completed for your ordination will last seven days.
What has been done today was commanded by the Lord to make atonement for you.
You must stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and do what the Lord requires so you will not die for that is what I have been commanded.
So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord commanded through Moses.
On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
He said to Aaron Take a bull calf for your sin offering and a ram for your burnt offering both without defect and present them before the Lord.
Then say to the Israelites Take a male goat for a sin offering a calf and a lambboth a year old and without defectfor a burnt offering
and an ox and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the Lord together with a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the Lord will appear to you. 
They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting and the entire assembly came near and stood before the Lord.
Then Moses said This is what the Lord has commanded you to do so that the glory of the Lord may appear to you.
Moses said to Aaron Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them as the Lord has commanded.
So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
His sons brought the blood to him and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
On the altar he burned the fat the kidneys and the covering of the liver from the sin offering as the Lord commanded Moses
the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.
Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece including the head and he burned them on the altar.
He washed the inner parts and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the peoples sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.
He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way.
He also brought the grain offering took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the mornings burnt offering.
He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
But the fat portions of the ox and the ramthe fat tail the layer of fat the kidneys and the covering of the liver
these they laid on the breasts and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.
Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the Lord as a wave offering as Moses commanded.
Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering the burnt offering and the fellowship offering he stepped down.
Moses and Aaron then went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came out they blessed the people and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.
Fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it they shouted for joy and fell facedown.
Aarons sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers put fire in them and added incense and they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord contrary to his command.
So fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed them and they died before the Lord.
Moses then said to Aaron This is what the Lord spoke of when he said  Among those who approach me I will show myself holy in the sight of all the people I will be honored.  Aaron remained silent.
Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan sons of Aarons uncle Uzziel and said to them Come here carry your cousins outside the camp away from the front of the sanctuary.
So they came and carried them still in their tunics outside the camp as Moses ordered.
Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar Do not let your hair become unkempt and do not tear your clothes or you will die and the Lord will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives all the house of Israel may mourn for those the Lord has destroyed by fire.
Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting or you will die because the Lords anointing oil is on you. So they did as Moses said.
Then the Lord said to Aaron
You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
You must distinguish between the holy and the common between the unclean and the clean
and you must teach the Israelites all the decrees the Lord has given them through Moses.
Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons Eleazar and Ithamar Take the grain offering left over from the offerings made to the Lord by fire and eat it prepared without yeast beside the altar for it is most holy.
Eat it in a holy place because it is your share and your sons share of the offerings made to the Lord by fire for so I have been commanded.
But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites fellowship offerings.
The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire to be waved before the Lord as a wave offering. This will be the regular share for you and your children as the Lord has commanded.
When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that it had been burned up he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar Aarons remaining sons and asked
Why didnt you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the Lord.
Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area as I commanded.
Aaron replied to Moses Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord but such things as this have happened to me. Would the Lord have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?
When Moses heard this he was satisfied.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Say to the Israelites Of all the animals that live on land these are the ones you may eat
You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.
And the pig though it has a split hoof completely divided does not chew the cud it is unclean for you.
You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses they are unclean for you.
 Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams you may eat any that have fins and scales.
But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scaleswhether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the wateryou are to detest.
And since you are to detest them you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses.
Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you.
 All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you.
There are however some winged creatures that walk on all fours that you may eat those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground.
Of these you may eat any kind of locust katydid cricket or grasshopper.
But all other winged creatures that have four legs you are to detest.
Of all those that move along the ground these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean till evening.
When one of them dies and falls on something that article whatever its use will be unclean whether it is made of wood cloth hide or sackcloth. Put it in water it will be unclean till evening and then it will be clean.
If one of them falls into a clay pot everything in it will be unclean and you must break the pot.
Any food that could be eaten but has water on it from such a pot is unclean and any liquid that could be drunk from it is unclean.
Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean an oven or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean and you are to regard them as unclean.
A spring however or a cistern for collecting water remains clean but anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean.
If a carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted they remain clean.
But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it it is unclean for you.
 If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies anyone who touches the carcass will be unclean till evening.
Anyone who eats some of the carcass must wash his clothes and he will be unclean till evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must wash his clothes and he will be unclean till evening.
 Every creature that moves about on the ground is detestable it is not to be eaten.
You are not to eat any creature that moves about on the ground whether it moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet it is detestable.
Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves unclean by means of them or be made unclean by them.
I am the Lord your God consecrate yourselves and be holy because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves about on the ground.
I am the Lord who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God therefore be holy because I am holy.
 These are the regulations concerning animals birds every living thing that moves in the water and every creature that moves about on the ground.
You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten. 
The Lord said to Moses
Say to the Israelites A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days just as she is unclean during her monthly period.
On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised.
Then the woman must wait thirtythree days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over.
If she gives birth to a daughter for two weeks the woman will be unclean as during her period. Then she must wait sixtysix days to be purified from her bleeding.
 When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a yearold lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering.
He shall offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her and then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood.  These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl.
If she cannot afford a lamb she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her and she will be clean.

He must burn up the clothing or the woven or knitted material of wool or linen or any leather article that has the contamination in it because the mildew is destructive the article must be burned up.
But if when the priest examines it the mildew has not spread in the clothing or the woven or knitted material or the leather article
he shall order that the contaminated article be washed. Then he is to isolate it for another seven days.
After the affected article has been washed the priest is to examine it and if the mildew has not changed its appearance even though it has not spread it is unclean. Burn it with fire whether the mildew has affected one side or the other.

The clothing or the woven or knitted material or any leather article that has been washed and is rid of the mildew must be washed again and it will be clean.
These are the regulations concerning contamination by mildew in woolen or linen clothing woven or knitted material or any leather article for pronouncing them clean or unclean.

The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when they approached the Lord.
The Lord said to Moses Tell your brother Aaron not to come whenever he chooses into the Most Holy Place behind the curtain in front of the atonement cover on the ark or else he will die because I appear in the cloud over the atonement cover.
This is how Aaron is to enter the sanctuary area with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
He is to put on the sacred linen tunic with linen undergarments next to his body he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments so he must bathe himself with water before he puts them on.
From the Israelite community he is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.
Then he is to take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
He is to cast lots for the two goatsone lot for the Lord and the other for the scapegoat.
Aaron shall bring the goat whose lot falls to the Lord and sacrifice it for a sin offering.
But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the desert as a scapegoat.
Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household and he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
He is to take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the Lord and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain.
He is to put the incense on the fire before the Lord and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the Testimony so that he will not die.
He is to take some of the bulls blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.
He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bulls blood He shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it.
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them This is what the Lord has commanded
Any Israelite who sacrifices an ox a lamb or a goat in the camp or outside of it
instead of bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to present it as an offering to the Lord in front of the tabernacle of the Lordthat man shall be considered guilty of bloodshed he has shed blood and must be cut off from his people.
This is so the Israelites will bring to the Lord the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields. They must bring them to the priest that is to the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings.
The priest is to sprinkle the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols to whom they prostitute themselves. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come.
Say to them Any Israelite or any alien living among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
and does not bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to the Lordthat man must be cut off from his people.
 Any Israelite or any alien living among them who eats any bloodI will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from his people.
For the life of a creature is in the blood and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar it is the blood that makes atonement for ones life.
Therefore I say to the Israelites None of you may eat blood nor may an alien living among you eat blood.
 Any Israelite or any alien living among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain out the blood and cover it with earth
because the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to the Israelites You must not eat the blood of any creature because the life of every creature is its blood anyone who eats it must be cut off.
 Anyone whether nativeborn or alien who eats anything found dead or torn by wild animals must wash his clothes and bathe with water and he will be ceremonially unclean till evening then he will be clean.
But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe himself he will be held responsible. 
The Lord said to Moses

I will set my face against that man and I will cut him off from his people for by giving his children to Molech he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name.
If the people of the community close their eyes when that man gives one of his children to Molech and they fail to put him to death
I will set my face against that man and his family and will cut off from their people both him and all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molech.

except for a close relative such as his mother or father his son or daughter his brother
or an unmarried sister who is dependent on him since she has no husbandfor her he may make himself unclean.
He must not make himself unclean for people related to him by marriage and so defile himself.
 Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies.
They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the offerings made to the Lord by fire the food of their God they are to be holy.
 They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands because priests are holy to their God.
Regard them as holy because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy because I the Lord am holyI who make you holy.
 If a priests daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute she disgraces her father she must be burned in the fire.
 The high priest the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments must not let his hair become unkempt or tear his clothes.
He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean even for his father or mother
nor leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it because he has been dedicated by the anointing oil of his God. I am the Lord.
 The woman he marries must be a virgin.
He must not marry a widow a divorced woman or a woman defiled by prostitution but only a virgin from his own people
so he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the Lord who makes him holy. 
The Lord said to Moses
Say to Aaron For the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God.
No man who has any defect may come near no man who is blind or lame disfigured or deformed
no man with a crippled foot or hand
or who is hunchbacked or dwarfed or who has any eye defect or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles.
No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the offerings made to the Lord by fire. He has a defect he must not come near to offer the food of his God.
He may eat the most holy food of his God as well as the holy food
yet because of his defect he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am the Lord who makes them holy. 
So Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
The Lord said to Moses
Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the Israelites consecrate to me so they will not profane my holy name. I am the Lord.
Say to them For the generations to come if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the Lord that person must be cut off from my presence. I am the Lord.
 If a descendant of Aaron has an infectious skin disease or a bodily discharge he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed. He will also be unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission of semen
or if he touches any crawling thing that makes him unclean or any person who makes him unclean whatever the uncleanness may be.
The one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening. He must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.
When the sun goes down he will be clean and after that he may eat the sacred offerings for they are his food.
He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals and so become unclean through it. I am the Lord.
 The priests are to keep my requirements so that they do not become guilty and die for treating them with contempt. I am the Lord who makes them holy.
 No one outside a priests family may eat the sacred offering nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it.
But if a priest buys a slave with money or if a slave is born in his household that slave may eat his food.
If a priests daughter marries anyone other than a priest she may not eat any of the sacred contributions.
But if a priests daughter becomes a widow or is divorced yet has no children and she returns to live in her fathers house as in her youth she may eat of her fathers food. No unauthorized person however may eat any of it.
 If anyone eats a sacred offering by mistake he must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it.
The priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the Israelites present to the Lord
by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them guilt requiring payment. I am the Lord who makes them holy. 
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them If any of youeither an Israelite or an alien living in Israelpresents a gift for a burnt offering to the Lord either to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering
you must present a male without defect from the cattle sheep or goats in order that it may be accepted on your behalf.
Do not bring anything with a defect because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
When anyone brings from the herd or flock a fellowship offering to the Lord to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering it must be without defect or blemish to be acceptable.
Do not offer to the Lord the blind the injured or the maimed or anything with warts or festering or running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar as an offering made to the Lord by fire.
You may however present as a freewill offering an ox or a sheep that is deformed or stunted but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow.
You must not offer to the Lord an animal whose testicles are bruised crushed torn or cut. You must not do this in your own land
and you must not accept such animals from the hand of a foreigner and offer them as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf because they are deformed and have defects. 
The Lord said to Moses
When a calf a lamb or a goat is born it is to remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on it will be acceptable as an offering made to the Lord by fire.
Do not slaughter a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day.
When you sacrifice a thank offering to the Lord sacrifice it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf.
It must be eaten that same day leave none of it till morning. I am the Lord.
Keep my commands and follow them. I am the Lord.
Do not profane my holy name. I must be acknowledged as holy by the Israelites. I am the Lord who makes you holy
and who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord.
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them These are my appointed feasts the appointed feasts of the Lord which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.
 There are six days when you may work but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work wherever you live it is a Sabbath to the Lord.

On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
For seven days present an offering made to the Lord by fire. And on the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work. 
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them When you enter the land I am going to give you and you reap its harvest bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain you harvest.
He is to wave the sheaf before the Lord so it will be accepted on your behalf the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
On the day you wave the sheaf you must sacrifice as a burnt offering to the Lord a lamb a year old without defect
together with its grain offering of twotenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oilan offering made to the Lord by fire a pleasing aromaand its drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine.
You must not eat any bread or roasted or new grain until the very day you bring this offering to your God. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come wherever you live.
 From the day after the Sabbath the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering count off seven full weeks.
Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath and then present an offering of new grain to the Lord.
From wherever you live bring two loaves made of twotenths of an ephah of fine flour baked with yeast as a wave offering of firstfruits to the Lord.
Present with this bread seven male lambs each a year old and without defect one young bull and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the Lord together with their grain offerings and drink offeringsan offering made by fire an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering and two lambs each a year old for a fellowship offering.
The priest is to wave the two lambs before the Lord as a wave offering together with the bread of the firstfruits. They are a sacred offering to the Lord for the priest.
On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly and do no regular work. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come wherever you live.
 When you reap the harvest of your land do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and the alien. I am the Lord your God. 
The Lord said to Moses
Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.
Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting Aaron is to tend the lamps before the Lord from evening till morning continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be tended continually.
Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread using twotenths of an ephah for each loaf.
Set them in two rows six in each row on the table of pure gold before the Lord.
Along each row put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be an offering made to the Lord by fire.
This bread is to be set out before the Lord regularly Sabbath after Sabbath on behalf of the Israelites as a lasting covenant.
It belongs to Aaron and his sons who are to eat it in a holy place because it is a most holy part of their regular share of the offerings made to the Lord by fire.
Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.
The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse so they brought him to Moses.
They put him in custody until the will of the Lord should be made clear to them.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head and the entire assembly is to stone him.
Say to the Israelites If anyone curses his God he will be held responsible
anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord must be put to death. The entire assembly must stone him. Whether an alien or nativeborn when he blasphemes the Name he must be put to death.
 If anyone takes the life of a human being he must be put to death.
Anyone who takes the life of someones animal must make restitutionlife for life.
If anyone injures his neighbor whatever he has done must be done to him
fracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth. As he has injured the other so he is to be injured.
Whoever kills an animal must make restitution but whoever kills a man must be put to death.
You are to have the same law for the alien and the nativeborn. I am the Lord your God. 
Then Moses spoke to the Israelites and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.
The Lord said to Moses on Mount Sinai
Speak to the Israelites and say to them When you enter the land I am going to give you the land itself must observe a sabbath to the Lord.
For six years sow your fields and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops.
But in the seventh year the land is to have a sabbath of rest a sabbath to the Lord. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.
Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.
Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for youfor yourself your manservant and maidservant and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you
as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.
 Count off seven sabbaths of yearsseven times seven yearsso that the seven sabbaths of years amount to a period of fortynine years.
Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land.
Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you each one of you is to return to his family property and each to his own clan.
The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.
For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you eat only what is taken directly from the fields.
 In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to his own property.
 If you sell land to one of your countrymen or buy any from him do not take advantage of each other.
You are to buy from your countryman on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And he is to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.
When the years are many you are to increase the price and when the years are few you are to decrease the price because what he is really selling you is the number of crops.
Do not take advantage of each other but fear your God. I am the Lord your God.
 Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws and you will live safely in the land.
Then the land will yield its fruit and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.
You may ask What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?
I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.
While you plant during the eighth year you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.
 The land must not be sold permanently because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants.
Throughout the country that you hold as a possession you must provide for the redemption of the land.
 If one of your countrymen becomes poor and sells some of his property his nearest relative is to come and redeem what his countryman has sold.
If however a man has no one to redeem it for him but he himself prospers and acquires sufficient means to redeem it
he is to determine the value for the years since he sold it and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it he can then go back to his own property.
But if he does not acquire the means to repay him what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee and he can then go back to his property.
 If a man sells a house in a walled city he retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time he may redeem it.
If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.
But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as open country. They can be redeemed and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.
 The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns which they possess.
So the property of the Levites is redeemablethat is a house sold in any town they holdand is to be returned in the Jubilee because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.
Do not take interest of any kind from him but fear your God so that your countryman may continue to live among you.
You must not lend him money at interest or sell him food at a profit.
I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
 If one of your countrymen becomes poor among you and sells himself to you do not make him work as a slave.
He is to be treated as a hired worker or a temporary resident among you he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
Then he and his children are to be released and he will go back to his own clan and to the property of his forefathers.
Because the Israelites are my servants whom I brought out of Egypt they must not be sold as slaves.
Do not rule over them ruthlessly but fear your God.
 Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you from them you may buy slaves.
You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country and they will become your property.
 Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it. I am the Lord your God.
 Observe my Sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am the Lord.
Five of you will chase a hundred and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.
 I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers and I will keep my covenant with you.
You will still be eating last years harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new.
I will put my dwelling place among you and I will not abhor you.
I will walk among you and be your God and you will be my people.
I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high.
 But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands
and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant
then I will do this to you I will bring upon you sudden terror wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and drain away your life. You will plant seed in vain because your enemies will eat it.
I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies those who hate you will rule over you and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.
 If after all this you will not listen to me I will punish you for your sins seven times over.
I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze.
Your strength will be spent in vain because your soil will not yield its crops nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit.
 If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me I will multiply your afflictions seven times over as your sins deserve.
I will send wild animals against you and they will rob you of your children destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted.
 If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me
I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over.
And I will bring the sword upon you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw into your cities I will send a plague among you and you will be given into enemy hands.
When I cut off your supply of bread ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven and they will dole out the bread by weight. You will eat but you will not be satisfied.
 If in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be hostile toward me
then in my anger I will be hostile toward you and I myself will punish you for your sins seven times over.
You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.
I will destroy your high places cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols and I will abhor you.
I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries and I will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings.
I will lay waste the land so that your enemies who live there will be appalled.
I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you. Your land will be laid waste and your cities will lie in ruins.
The Lord said to Moses
and if it is a female set her value at thirty shekels.
But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee and its set value will be reduced.
If the man who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it he must add a fifth to its value and the field will again become his.
The Lord spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said
Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families listing every man by name one by one.

The Lord said to Moses and Aaron

These are the Israelites counted according to their families. All those in the camps by their divisions number 603550.
The Levites however were not counted along with the other Israelites as the Lord commanded Moses.
So the Israelites did everything the Lord commanded Moses that is the way they encamped under their standards and that is the way they set out each with his clan and family.
This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the Lord talked with Moses on Mount Sinai.
The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar.
Those were the names of Aarons sons the anointed priests who were ordained to serve as priests.
Nadab and Abihu however fell dead before the Lord when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons so only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
The Lord said to Moses
Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the Tent of Meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.
They are to take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.
Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.
Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to death.
The Lord also said to Moses
I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine
for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel whether man or animal. They are to be mine. I am the Lord.
The Lord said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai
Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more.
So Moses counted them as he was commanded by the word of the Lord.
These were the names of the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari.
These were the names of the Gershonite clans Libni and Shimei.
The Kohathite clans Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel.
The Merarite clans Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans according to their families.
To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites these were the Gershonite clans.
The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7500.
The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west behind the tabernacle.
The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
At the Tent of Meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent its coverings the curtain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting
the curtains of the courtyard the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar and the ropesand everything related to their use.
To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites Izharites Hebronites and Uzzielites these were the Kohathite clans.

The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
They were responsible for the care of the ark the table the lampstand the altars the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering the curtain and everything related to their use.
The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites these were the Merarite clans.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.
Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work in the Tent of Meeting.
This is the work of the Kohathites in the Tent of Meeting the care of the most holy things.
When the camp is to move Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.
Then they are to cover this with hides of sea cows spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place.
Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates dishes and bowls and the jars for drink offerings the bread that is continually there is to remain on it.
Over these they are to spread a scarlet cloth cover that with hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light together with its lamps its wick trimmers and trays and all its jars for the oil used to supply it.
Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of hides of sea cows and put it on a carrying frame.
Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary wrap them in a blue cloth cover that with hides of sea cows and put them on a carrying frame.

Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar including the firepans meat forks shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles and when the camp is ready to move the Kohathites are to come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the Tent of Meeting.
Eleazar son of Aaron the priest is to have charge of the oil for the light the fragrant incense the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it including its holy furnishings and articles.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron
See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not cut off from the Levites.
So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things do this for them Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his work and what he is to carry.
But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things even for a moment or they will die.
The Lord said to Moses
Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans.
Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
This is the service of the Gershonite clans as they work and carry burdens
They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle the Tent of Meeting its covering and the outer covering of hides of sea cows the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting

All their service whether carrying or doing other work is to be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them as their responsibility all they are to carry.
This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the Tent of Meeting. Their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
Count the Merarites by their clans and families.
Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
The Lord said to Moses
Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has an infectious skin disease or a discharge of any kind or who is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body.
Send away male and female alike send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp where I dwell among them.
The Israelites did this they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the Lord had instructed Moses.
The Lord said to Moses
Say to the Israelites When a man or woman wrongs another in any way and so is unfaithful to the Lord that person is guilty
and must confess the sin he has committed. He must make full restitution for his wrong add one fifth to it and give it all to the person he has wronged.
But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong the restitution belongs to the Lord and must be given to the priest along with the ram with which atonement is made for him.
All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.
Each mans sacred gifts are his own but what he gives to the priest will belong to the priest. 
Then the Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them If a mans wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
by sleeping with another man and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected 
and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impureor if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure
then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour oil on it or put incense on it because it is a grain offering for jealousy a reminder offering to draw attention to guilt.
 The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord.
Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.
After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder offering the grain offering for jealousy while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse.
Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her If no other man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you.
But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have defiled yourself by sleeping with a man other than your husband
here the priest is to put the woman under this curse of the oathmay the Lord cause your people to curse and denounce you when he causes your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell.
May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells and your thigh wastes away.  Then the woman is to say Amen. So be it.
 The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.
He shall have the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse and this water will enter her and cause bitter suffering.
The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy wave it before the Lord and bring it to the altar.
The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar after that he is to have the woman drink the water.
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them If a man or woman wants to make a special vow a vow of separation to the Lord as a Nazirite
he must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or from other fermented drink. He must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.
As long as he is a Nazirite he must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine not even the seeds or skins.
 During the entire period of his vow of separation no razor may be used on his head. He must be holy until the period of his separation to the Lord is over he must let the hair of his head grow long.
Throughout the period of his separation to the Lord he must not go near a dead body.
Even if his own father or mother or brother or sister dies he must not make himself ceremonially unclean on account of them because the symbol of his separation to God is on his head.
Throughout the period of his separation he is consecrated to the Lord.
 If someone dies suddenly in his presence thus defiling the hair he has dedicated he must shave his head on the day of his cleansingthe seventh day.
Then on the eighth day he must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for him because he sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day he is to consecrate his head.
When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.
Then the leaders of Israel the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted made offerings.
They brought as their gifts before the Lord six covered carts and twelve oxenan ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle.
The Lord said to Moses
Accept these from them that they may be used in the work at the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites as each mans work requires.
So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites as their work required
and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things for which they were responsible.
When the altar was anointed the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.
For the Lord had said to Moses Each day one leader is to bring his offering for the dedication of the altar.
The one who brought his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah.
His offering was one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels both according to the sanctuary shekel each filled with fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering
one gold dish weighing ten shekels filled with incense
one young bull one ram and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering
one male goat for a sin offering
and two oxen five rams five male goats and five male lambs a year old to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab.
On the second day Nethanel son of Zuar the leader of Issachar brought his offering.
The offering he brought was one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels both according to the sanctuary shekel each filled with fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering
one gold dish weighing ten shekels filled with incense
one young bull one ram and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering
one male goat for a sin offering
and two oxen five rams five male goats and five male lambs a year old to be sacrificed as a fellowship offering. This was the offering of Nethanel son of Zuar.
On the third day Eliab son of Helon the leader of the people of Zebulun brought his offering.
His offering was one silver plate weighing a hundred and thirty shekels and one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels both according to the sanctuary shekel each filled with fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to Aaron and say to him When you set up the seven lamps they are to light the area in front of the lampstand. 
Aaron did so he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand just as the Lord commanded Moses.
This is how the lampstand was made It was made of hammered goldfrom its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the Lord had shown Moses.
The Lord said to Moses
Take the Levites from among the other Israelites and make them ceremonially clean.
To purify them do this Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes and so purify themselves.
Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
Bring the Levites to the front of the Tent of Meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community.
You are to bring the Levites before the Lord and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them.
Aaron is to present the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the Israelites so that they may be ready to do the work of the Lord.
After the Levites lay their hands on the heads of the bulls use the one for a sin offering to the Lord and the other for a burnt offering to make atonement for the Levites.
Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present them as a wave offering to the Lord.
In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites and the Levites will be mine.
After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering they are to come to do their work at the Tent of Meeting.
They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn the first male offspring from every Israelite woman.
Every firstborn male in Israel whether man or animal is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt I set them apart for myself.
And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel.
Of all the Israelites I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the Tent of Meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary.
Moses Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the Lord commanded Moses.
The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the Lord and made atonement for them to purify them.
After that the Levites came to do their work at the Tent of Meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the Lord commanded Moses.
The Lord spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said
Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time.
Celebrate it at the appointed time at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month in accordance with all its rules and regulations.
So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover
and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the Lord commanded Moses.
But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day
and said to Moses We have become unclean because of a dead body but why should we be kept from presenting the Lords offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?
Moses answered them Wait until I find out what the Lord commands concerning you.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Tell the Israelites When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey they may still celebrate the Lords Passover.
They are to celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover they must follow all the regulations.
But if a man who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover that person must be cut off from his people because he did not present the Lords offering at the appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin.
 An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the Lords Passover must do so in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for the alien and the nativeborn. 
On the day the tabernacle the Tent of the Testimony was set up the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire.
That is how it continued to be the cloud covered it and at night it looked like fire.
Whenever the cloud lifted from above the Tent the Israelites set out wherever the cloud settled the Israelites encamped.
At the Lords command the Israelites set out and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle they remained in camp.
When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time the Israelites obeyed the Lords order and did not set out.
Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days at the Lords command they would encamp and then at his command they would set out.
Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning and when it lifted in the morning they set out. Whether by day or by night whenever the cloud lifted they set out.
Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out but when it lifted they would set out.
At the Lords command they encamped and at the Lords command they set out. They obeyed the Lords order in accordance with his command through Moses.
The Lord said to Moses
Make two trumpets of hammered silver and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out.
When both are sounded the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
If only one is sounded the leadersthe heads of the clans of Israelare to assemble before you.
When a trumpet blast is sounded the tribes camping on the east are to set out.
At the sounding of a second blast the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out.
To gather the assembly blow the trumpets but not with the same signal.
Also at your times of rejoicingyour appointed feasts and New Moon festivalsyou are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the Lord your God.
On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony.
Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.
They set out this first time at the Lords command through Moses.
The divisions of the camp of Judah went first under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.
Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar
and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
Then the tabernacle was taken down and the Gershonites and Merarites who carried it set out.
The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.
Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon
and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
Then the Kohathites set out carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command.
Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh
and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
Finally as the rear guard for all the units the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.
Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher
and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite Moses fatherinlaw We are setting out for the place about which the Lord said I will give it to you. Come with us and we will treat you well for the Lord has promised good things to Israel.
He answered No I will not go I am going back to my own land and my own people.
But Moses said Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert and you can be our eyes.
If you come with us we will share with you whatever good things the Lord gives us.
So they set out from the mountain of the Lord and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.
The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the Lord and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the Lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.
When the people cried out to Moses he prayed to the Lord and the fire died down.
So that place was called Taberah because fire from the Lord had burned among them.
The rabble with them began to crave other food and again the Israelites started wailing and said If only we had meat to eat!
We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no costalso the cucumbers melons leeks onions and garlic.
But now we have lost our appetite we never see anything but this manna!
The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.
The people went around gathering it and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.
When the dew settled on the camp at night the manna also came down.
Moses heard the people of every family wailing each at the entrance to his tent. The Lord became exceedingly angry and Moses was troubled.
He asked the Lord Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?
Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms as a nurse carries an infant to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?
Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me Give us meat to eat!
I cannot carry all these people by myself the burden is too heavy for me.
If this is how you are going to treat me put me to death right nowif I have found favor in your eyesand do not let me face my own ruin.
Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife for he had married a Cushite.
Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? they asked. Hasnt he also spoken through us? And the Lord heard this.

At once the Lord said to Moses Aaron and Miriam Come out to the Tent of Meeting all three of you. So the three of them came out.
Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward
he said Listen to my words When a prophet of the Lord is among you I reveal myself to him in visions I speak to him in dreams.
But this is not true of my servant Moses he is faithful in all my house.
With him I speak face to face clearly and not in riddles he sees the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
The anger of the Lord burned against them and he left them.
When the cloud lifted from above the Tent there stood Miriamleprous like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy
and he said to Moses Please my lord do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.
Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mothers womb with its flesh half eaten away.
So Moses cried out to the Lord O God please heal her!
The Lord replied to Moses If her father had spit in her face would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days after that she can be brought back.
So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days and the people did not move on till she was brought back.
After that the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.
The Lord said to Moses
Send some men to explore the land of Canaan which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.
So at the Lords command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
These are their names from the tribe of Reuben Shammua son of Zaccur
from the tribe of Simeon Shaphat son of Hori
from the tribe of Judah Caleb son of Jephunneh
from the tribe of Issachar Igal son of Joseph
from the tribe of Ephraim Hoshea son of Nun
from the tribe of Benjamin Palti son of Raphu
from the tribe of Zebulun Gaddiel son of Sodi
from the tribe of Manasseh  Gaddi son of Susi
from the tribe of Dan Ammiel son of Gemalli
from the tribe of Asher Sethur son of Michael
from the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi son of Vophsi
from the tribe of Gad Geuel son of Maki.
These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land.
When Moses sent them to explore Canaan he said Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.
See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak few or many.
What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?
How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.
So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob toward Lebo Hamath.
They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron where Ahiman Sheshai and Talmai the descendants of Anak lived.
When they reached the Valley of Eshcol they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them along with some pomegranates and figs.
That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.
They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.
They gave Moses this account We went into the land to which you sent us and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.
But the people who live there are powerful and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.
The Amalekites live in the Negev the Hittites Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.
Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said We should go up and take possession of the land for we can certainly do it.
But the men who had gone up with him said We cant attack those people they are stronger than we are.
And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.
We saw the Nephilim there . We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes and we looked the same to them.
That night all the people of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.
All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly said to them If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this desert!
Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldnt it be better for us to go back to Egypt?
Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh who were among those who had explored the land tore their clothes
and said to the entire Israelite assembly The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.
If the Lord is pleased with us he will lead us into that land a land flowing with milk and honey and will give it to us.
Only do not rebel against the Lord. And do not be afraid of the people of the land because we will swallow them up. Their protection is gone but the Lord is with us. Do not be afraid of them.
But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites.
The Lord said to Moses How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them?
I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they.
Moses said to the Lord Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.
And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you O Lord are with these people and that you O Lord have been seen face to face that your cloud stays over them and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
If you put these people to death all at one time the nations who have heard this report about you will say
The Lord was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath so he slaughtered them in the desert.
Now may the Lords strength be displayed just as you have declared
The Lord is slow to anger abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.
In accordance with your great love forgive the sin of these people just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.
The Lord replied I have forgiven them as you asked.
Nevertheless as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the Lord fills the whole earth
not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times
not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their forefathers. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.
But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly I will bring him into the land he went to and his descendants will inherit it.
Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron
How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
So tell them As surely as I live declares the Lord I will do to you the very things I heard you say
In this desert your bodies will fallevery one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.
Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.
But youyour bodies will fall in this desert.
Your children will be shepherds here for forty years suffering for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the desert.
For forty yearsone year for each of the forty days you explored the landyou will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.
I the Lord have spoken and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this desert here they will die.
So the men Moses had sent to explore the land who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it
these men responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the Lord.
Of the men who went to explore the land only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.
When Moses reported this to all the Israelites they mourned bitterly.
Early the next morning they went up toward the high hill country. We have sinned they said. We will go up to the place the Lord promised.
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them After you enter the land I am giving you as a home
and you present to the Lord offerings made by fire from the herd or the flock as an aroma pleasing to the Lordwhether burnt offerings or sacrifices for special vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings
then the one who brings his offering shall present to the Lord a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil.
With each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
 With a ram prepare a grain offering of twotenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil
and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
 When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice for a special vow or a fellowship offering to the Lord
bring with the bull a grain offering of threetenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.
Also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering. It will be an offering made by fire an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
Each bull or ram each lamb or young goat is to be prepared in this manner.
Do this for each one for as many as you prepare.
 Everyone who is nativeborn must do these things in this way when he brings an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
For the generations to come whenever an alien or anyone else living among you presents an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the Lord he must do exactly as you do.
The community is to have the same rules for you and for the alien living among you this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You and the alien shall be the same before the Lord
The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the alien living among you. 
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them When you enter the land to which I am taking you
and you eat the food of the land present a portion as an offering to the Lord.
Present a cake from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor.
Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the Lord from the first of your ground meal.
 Now if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the Lord gave Moses
any of the Lords commands to you through him from the day the Lord gave them and continuing through the generations to come
and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the Lord along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering and a male goat for a sin offering.
The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community and they will be forgiven for it was not intentional and they have brought to the Lord for their wrong an offering made by fire and a sin offering.
The whole Israelite community and the aliens living among them will be forgiven because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong.
 But if just one person sins unintentionally he must bring a yearold female goat for a sin offering.
The priest is to make atonement before the Lord for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally and when atonement has been made for him he will be forgiven.
One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally whether he is a nativeborn Israelite or an alien.
 But anyone who sins defiantly whether nativeborn or alien blasphemes the Lord and that person must be cut off from his people.
Because he has despised the Lords word and broken his commands that person must surely be cut off his guilt remains on him. 
While the Israelites were in the desert a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly
and they kept him in custody because it was not clear what should be done to him.
Then the Lord said to Moses The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.
So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death as the Lord commanded Moses.
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments with a blue cord on each tassel.
You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the Lord that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by going after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes.
Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God.
I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God. 
Korah son of Izhar the son of Kohath the son of Levi and certain ReubenitesDathan and Abiram sons of Eliab and On son of Pelethbecame insolent
and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men wellknown community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.
They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them You have gone too far! The whole community is holy every one of them and the Lord is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the Lords assembly?
When Moses heard this he fell facedown.
Then he said to Korah and all his followers In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to him and who is holy and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.
You Korah and all your followers are to do this Take censers
and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the Lord. The man the Lord chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!
Moses also said to Korah Now listen you Levites!
Isnt it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the Lords tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?
He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.
It is against the Lord that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?
Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab. But they said We will not come!
The Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff.
On the staff of Levi write Aarons name for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.
Place them in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony where I meet with you.
The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.
So Moses spoke to the Israelites and their leaders gave him twelve staffs one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes and Aarons staff was among them.
Moses placed the staffs before the Lord in the Tent of the Testimony.
The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aarons staff which represented the house of Levi had not only sprouted but had budded blossomed and produced almonds.
Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the Lords presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them and each man took his own staff.
The Lord said to Moses Put back Aarons staff in front of the Testimony to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me so that they will not die.
Moses did just as the Lord commanded him.
The Israelites said to Moses We will die! We are lost we are all lost!
Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the Lord will die. Are we all going to die?
The Lord said to Aaron You your sons and your fathers family are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the sanctuary and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the priesthood.
Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the Tent of the Testimony.
They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the Tent but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar or both they and you will die.
They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the Tent of Meetingall the work at the Tentand no one else may come near where you are.
You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar so that wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.
I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you dedicated to the Lord to do the work at the Tent of Meeting.
But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death.
Then the Lord said to Aaron I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion and regular share.
You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings whether grain or sin or guilt offerings that part belongs to you and your sons.
Eat it as something most holy every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.
This also is yours whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your regular share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the Lord as the firstfruits of their harvest.
All the lands firstfruits that they bring to the Lord will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
Everything in Israel that is devoted to the Lord is yours.
The first offspring of every womb both man and animal that is offered to the Lord is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.
When they are a month old you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver according to the sanctuary shekel which weighs twenty gerahs.
But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox a sheep or a goat they are holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
Their meat is to be yours just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.
Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the Lord I give to you and your sons and daughters as your regular share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord for both you and your offspring.
The Lord said to Aaron You will have no inheritance in their land nor will you have any share among them I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.
I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the Tent of Meeting.
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron
This is a requirement of the law that the Lord has commanded Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.
Give it to Eleazar the priest it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting.
While he watches the heifer is to be burnedits hide flesh blood and offal.
The priest is to take some cedar wood hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.
After that the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.
The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water and he too will be unclean till evening.
A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They shall be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing it is for purification from sin.
The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the aliens living among them.
Whoever touches the dead body of anyone will be unclean for seven days.
He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days he will not be clean.
Whoever touches the dead body of anyone and fails to purify himself defiles the Lords tabernacle. That person must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him he is unclean his uncleanness remains on him.
This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days
and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.
Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave will be unclean for seven days.
For the unclean person put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them.
Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or someone who has been killed or someone who has died a natural death.
The man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days and on the seventh day he is to purify him. The person being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe with water and that evening he will be clean.
But if a person who is unclean does not purify himself he must be cut off from the community because he has defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him and he is unclean.
This is a lasting ordinance for them. The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening.
Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening.
In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
Now there was no water for the community and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron.
They quarreled with Moses and said If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the Lord!
Why did you bring the Lords community into this desert that we and our livestock should die here?
Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!
Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and fell facedown and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
The Lord said to Moses
Take the staff and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.
So Moses took the staff from the Lords presence just as he commanded him.
He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them Listen you rebels must we bring you water out of this rock?
Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out and the community and their livestock drank.
But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites you will not bring this community into the land I give them.
These were the waters of Meribah where the Israelites quarreled with the Lord and where he showed himself holy among them.
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom saying This is what your brother Israel says You know about all the hardships that have come upon us.
Our forefathers went down into Egypt and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers
but when we cried out to the Lord he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. Now we are here at Kadesh a town on the edge of your territory.
Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard or drink water from any well. We will travel along the kings highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.
But Edom answered You may not pass through here if you try we will march out and attack you with the sword.
The Israelites replied We will go along the main road and if we or our livestock drink any of your water we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on footnothing else.
Again they answered You may not pass through. Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.
Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory Israel turned away from them.
The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
At Mount Hor near the border of Edom the Lord said to Moses and Aaron
Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor.
Remove Aarons garments and put them on his son Eleazar for Aaron will be gathered to his people he will die there.
Moses did as the Lord commanded They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
Moses removed Aarons garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain
and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days.
When the Canaanite king of Arad who lived in the Negev heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.
Then Israel made this vow to the Lord If you will deliver these people into our hands we will totally destroy their cities.
The Lord listened to Israels plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns so the place was named Hormah.
They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way
they spoke against God and against Moses and said Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!
Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them they bit the people and many Israelites died.
The people came to Moses and said We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us. So Moses prayed for the people.
The Lord said to Moses Make a snake and put it up on a pole anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.
So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake he lived.
The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.
Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim in the desert that faces Moab toward the sunrise.
From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.
They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon which is in the desert extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab between Moab and the Amorites.
That is why the Book of the Wars of the Lord says . . . Waheb in Suphah and the ravines the Arnon
and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.
From there they continued on to Beer the well where the Lord said to Moses Gather the people together and I will give them water.
Then Israel sang this song Spring up O well! Sing about it
about the well that the princes dug that the nobles of the people sank the nobles with scepters and staffs. Then they went from the desert to Mattanah
from Mattanah to Nahaliel from Nahaliel to Bamoth
and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites
Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard or drink water from any well. We will travel along the kings highway until we have passed through your territory.
But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz he fought with Israel.
Israel however put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok but only as far as the Ammonites because their border was fortified.
Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.
Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.
That is why the poets say Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt let Sihons city be restored.
Fire went out from Heshbon a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab the citizens of Arnons heights.
Woe to you O Moab! You are destroyed O people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites.
But we have overthrown them Heshbon is destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah which extends to Medeba.
So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
After Moses had sent spies to Jazer the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.
Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.
The Lord said to Moses Do not be afraid of him for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon.
So they struck him down together with his sons and his whole army leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.
Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.
Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites
and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.
The Moabites said to the elders of Midian This horde is going to lick up everything around us as an ox licks up the grass of the field. So Balak son of Zippor who was king of Moab at that time
sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor who was at Pethor near the River in his native land. Balak said A people has come out of Egypt they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.
Now come and put a curse on these people because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For I know that those you bless are blessed and those you curse are cursed.
The elders of Moab and Midian left taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam they told him what Balak had said.
Spend the night here Balaam said to them and I will bring you back the answer the Lord gives me. So the Moabite princes stayed with him.
God came to Balaam and asked Who are these men with you?
Balaam said to God Balak son of Zippor king of Moab sent me this message
A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away. 
But God said to Balaam Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people because they are blessed.
The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balaks princes Go back to your own country for the Lord has refused to let me go with you.
So the Moabite princes returned to Balak and said Balaam refused to come with us.
Then Balak sent other princes more numerous and more distinguished than the first.
They came to Balaam and said This is what Balak son of Zippor says Do not let anything keep you from coming to me
because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.
But Balaam answered them Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the Lord my God.
Now stay here tonight as the others did and I will find out what else the Lord will tell me.
That night God came to Balaam and said Since these men have come to summon you go with them but do only what I tell you.
Balaam got up in the morning saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.
But God was very angry when he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him.
When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand she turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat her to get her back on the road.
Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path between two vineyards with walls on both sides.
When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord she pressed close to the wall crushing Balaams foot against it. So he beat her again.
Then the angel of the Lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn either to the right or to the left.
When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord she lay down under Balaam and he was angry and beat her with his staff.
Then the Lord opened the donkeys mouth and she said to Balaam What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?
Balaam answered the donkey You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand I would kill you right now.
Balaam said Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.
Balak did as Balaam said and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Then Balaam said to Balak Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you. Then he went off to a barren height.
God met with him and Balaam said I have prepared seven altars and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.
The Lord put a message in Balaams mouth and said Go back to Balak and give him this message.
So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering with all the princes of Moab.
Then Balaam uttered his oracle Balak brought me from Aram the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. Come he said curse Jacob for me come denounce Israel.
How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced?
From the rocky peaks I see them from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.
Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous and may my end be like theirs!
Balak said to Balaam What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies but you have done nothing but bless them!
He answered Must I not speak what the Lord puts in my mouth?
Then Balak said to him Come with me to another place where you can see them you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there curse them for me.
So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
Balaam said to Balak Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there.
The Lord met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said Go back to Balak and give him this message.
So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering with the princes of Moab. Balak asked him What did the Lord say?
Then he uttered his oracle Arise Balak and listen hear me son of Zippor.
God is not a man that he should lie nor a son of man that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?
I have received a command to bless he has blessed and I cannot change it.
No misfortune is seen in Jacob no misery observed in Israel. The Lord their God is with them the shout of the King is among them.
God brought them out of Egypt they have the strength of a wild ox.
There is no sorcery against Jacob no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel See what God has done!
The people rise like a lioness they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims.
Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel he did not resort to sorcery as at other times but turned his face toward the desert.
When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe the Spirit of God came upon him
and he uttered his oracle The oracle of Balaam son of Beor the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly
the oracle of one who hears the words of God who sees a vision from the Almighty who falls prostrate and whose eyes are opened
How beautiful are your tents O Jacob your dwelling places O Israel!
Like valleys they spread out like gardens beside a river like aloes planted by the Lord like cedars beside the waters.
Water will flow from their buckets their seed will have abundant water. Their king will be greater than Agag their kingdom will be exalted.
God brought them out of Egypt they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces with their arrows they pierce them.
Like a lion they crouch and lie down like a lionesswho dares to rouse them? May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!
Then Balaks anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him I summoned you to curse my enemies but you have blessed them these three times.
Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely but the Lord has kept you from being rewarded.
Balaam answered Balak Did I not tell the messengers you sent me
Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold I could not do anything of my own accord good or bad to go beyond the command of the Lordand I must say only what the Lord says?
Now I am going back to my people but come let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.
Then he uttered his oracle The oracle of Balaam son of Beor the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly
the oracle of one who hears the words of God who has knowledge from the Most High who sees a vision from the Almighty who falls prostrate and whose eyes are opened
I see him but not now I behold him but not near. A star will come out of Jacob a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab the skulls of all the sons of Sheth.
While Israel was staying in Shittim the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women
who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate and bowed down before these gods.
and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear through both of themthrough the Israelite and into the womans body. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped
but those who died in the plague numbered 24000.
The Lord said to Moses
Phinehas son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest has turned my anger away from the Israelites for he was as zealous as I am for my honor among them so that in my zeal I did not put an end to them.
After the plague the Lord said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest
Take a census of the whole Israelite community by familiesall those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel.
So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said
Take a census of the men twenty years old or more as the Lord commanded Moses. These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt
The descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were through Hanoch the Hanochite clan through Pallu the Palluite clan
through Hezron the Hezronite clan through Carmi the Carmite clan.
These were the clans of Reuben those numbered were 43730.
The son of Pallu was Eliab
and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan and Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among Korahs followers when they rebelled against the Lord.
The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah whose followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men. And they served as a warning sign.
The line of Korah however did not die out.
The descendants of Simeon by their clans were through Nemuel the Nemuelite clan through Jamin the Jaminite clan through Jakin the Jakinite clan
through Zerah the Zerahite clan through Shaul the Shaulite clan.
These were the clans of Simeon there were 22200 men.
The descendants of Gad by their clans were through Zephon the Zephonite clan through Haggi the Haggite clan through Shuni the Shunite clan
through Ozni the Oznite clan through Eri the Erite clan
through Arodi the Arodite clan through Areli the Arelite clan.
These were the clans of Gad those numbered were 40500.
Er and Onan were sons of Judah but they died in Canaan.
The descendants of Judah by their clans were through Shelah the Shelanite clan through Perez the Perezite clan through Zerah the Zerahite clan.
The descendants of Perez were through Hezron the Hezronite clan through Hamul the Hamulite clan.
These were the clans of Judah those numbered were 76500.
The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Makir the son of Manasseh belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah Noah Hoglah Milcah and Tirzah. They approached
the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and stood before Moses Eleazar the priest the leaders and the whole assembly and said
Our father died in the desert. He was not among Korahs followers who banded together against the Lord but he died for his own sin and left no sons.
Why should our fathers name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our fathers relatives.
So Moses brought their case before the Lord
and the Lord said to him
What Zelophehads daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their fathers relatives and turn their fathers inheritance over to them.
Say to the Israelites If a man dies and leaves no son turn his inheritance over to his daughter.
If he has no daughter give his inheritance to his brothers.
If he has no brothers give his inheritance to his fathers brothers.
If his father had no brothers give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan that he may possess it. This is to be a legal requirement for the Israelites as the Lord commanded Moses. 
Then the Lord said to Moses Go up this mountain in the Abarim range and see the land I have given the Israelites.
After you have seen it you too will be gathered to your people as your brother Aaron was
for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes.
Moses said to the Lord
May the Lord the God of the spirits of all mankind appoint a man over this community
to go out and come in before them one who will lead them out and bring them in so the Lords people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.
So the Lord said to Moses Take Joshua son of Nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay your hand on him.
Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence.
Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him.
He is to stand before Eleazar the priest who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the Lord. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out and at his command they will come in.
Moses did as the Lord commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly.
Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him as the Lord instructed through Moses.
The Lord said to Moses
Give this command to the Israelites and say to them See that you present to me at the appointed time the food for my offerings made by fire as an aroma pleasing to me.
Say to them This is the offering made by fire that you are to present to the Lord two lambs a year old without defect as a regular burnt offering each day.
Prepare one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight
together with a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives.
This is the regular burnt offering instituted at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma an offering made to the Lord by fire.
The accompanying drink offering is to be a quarter of a hin of fermented drink with each lamb. Pour out the drink offering to the Lord at the sanctuary.
Prepare the second lamb at twilight along with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering that you prepare in the morning. This is an offering made by fire an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
 On the Sabbath day make an offering of two lambs a year old without defect together with its drink offering and a grain offering of twotenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil.

With each bull there is to be a grain offering of threetenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil with the ram a grain offering of twotenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil
and with each lamb a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil. This is for a burnt offering a pleasing aroma an offering made to the Lord by fire.
With each bull there is to be a drink offering of half a hin of wine with the ram a third of a hin and with each lamb a quarter of a hin. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon during the year.
Besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering one male goat is to be presented to the Lord as a sin offering.
 On the fourteenth day of the first month the Lords Passover is to be held.
On the fifteenth day of this month there is to be a festival for seven days eat bread made without yeast.

On the seventh day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.

Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel This is what the Lord commands
When a man makes a vow to the Lord or takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge he must not break his word but must do everything he said.
When a young woman still living in her fathers house makes a vow to the Lord or obligates herself by a pledge
and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her then all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand.
But if her father forbids her when he hears about it none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand the Lord will release her because her father has forbidden her.
If she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise by which she obligates herself
and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand.
But if her husband forbids her when he hears about it he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself and the Lord will release her.
Any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on her.
If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by a pledge under oath
and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her and does not forbid her then all her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand.
But if her husband nullifies them when he hears about them then none of the vows or pledges that came from her lips will stand. Her husband has nullified them and the Lord will release her.
Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself.
But if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day then he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her when he hears about them.
If however he nullifies them some time after he hears about them then he is responsible for her guilt.
These are the regulations the Lord gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife and between a father and his young daughter still living in his house.
The Lord said to Moses
Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that you will be gathered to your people.
So twelve thousand men armed for battle a thousand from each tribe were supplied from the clans of Israel.
Moses sent them into battle a thousand from each tribe along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
They fought against Midian as the Lord commanded Moses and killed every man.
Among their victims were Evi Rekem Zur Hur and Rebathe five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds flocks and goods as plunder.
They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled as well as all their camps.
They took all the plunder and spoils including the people and animals
and brought the captives spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
Moses Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.
Moses was angry with the officers of the armythe commanders of thousands and commanders of hundredswho returned from the battle.
Have you allowed all the women to live? he asked them.
They were the ones who followed Balaams advice and were the means of turning the Israelites away from the Lord in what happened at Peor so that a plague struck the Lords people.
Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man
but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
All of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.
Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather goat hair or wood.
Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle This is the requirement of the law that the Lord gave Moses
Gold silver bronze iron tin lead
and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.
On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.
The Lord said to Moses
You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured.
Divide the spoils between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.
From the soldiers who fought in the battle set apart as tribute for the Lord one out of every five hundred whether persons cattle donkeys sheep or goats.
Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the Lords part.
From the Israelites half select one out of every fifty whether persons cattle donkeys sheep goats or other animals. Give them to the Levites who are responsible for the care of the Lords tabernacle.
So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.
The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675000 sheep
72000 cattle
61000 donkeys
and 32000 women who had never slept with a man.
The half share of those who fought in the battle was 337500 sheep
of which the tribute for the Lord was 675
36000 cattle of which the tribute for the Lord was 72
30500 donkeys of which the tribute for the Lord was 61
16000 people of which the tribute for the Lord was 32.
Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the Lords part as the Lord commanded Moses.
The Reubenites and Gadites who had very large herds and flocks saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.
So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community and said
Ataroth Dibon Jazer Nimrah Heshbon Elealeh Sebam Nebo and Beon
the land the Lord subdued before the people of Israelare suitable for livestock and your servants have livestock.
If we have found favor in your eyes they said let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.
Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites Shall your countrymen go to war while you sit here?
Why do you discourage the Israelites from going over into the land the Lord has given them?
This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.
After they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the Lord had given them.
The Lords anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath
Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly not one of the men twenty years old or more who came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob
not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun for they followed the Lord wholeheartedly.
The Lords anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the desert forty years until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.
And here you are a brood of sinners standing in the place of your fathers and making the Lord even more angry with Israel.
If you turn away from following him he will again leave all this people in the desert and you will be the cause of their destruction.
And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon Elealeh and Kiriathaim
as well as Nebo and Baal Meon  and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.
The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there.
So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites the descendants of Manasseh and they settled there.
Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
At the Lords command Moses recorded the stages in their journey. This is their journey by stages
The Israelites set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month the day after the Passover. They marched out boldly in full view of all the Egyptians
who were burying all their firstborn whom the Lord had struck down among them for the Lord had brought judgment on their gods.
The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Succoth.
They left Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
They left Etham turned back to Pi Hahiroth to the east of Baal Zephon and camped near Migdol.
They left Pi Hahiroth and passed through the sea into the desert and when they had traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham they camped at Marah.
They left Marah and went to Elim where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees and they camped there.
They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.
They left the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.
They left Alush and camped at Rephidim where there was no water for the people to drink.
They left Rephidim and camped in the Desert of Sinai.
They left the Desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
They left Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
The Lord said to Moses
Command the Israelites and say to them When you enter Canaan the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance will have these boundaries
 Your southern side will include some of the Desert of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east your southern boundary will start from the end of the Salt Sea
cross south of Scorpion Pass continue on to Zin and go south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon
where it will turn join the Wadi of Egypt and end at the Sea.
 Your western boundary will be the coast of the Great Sea. This will be your boundary on the west.
 For your northern boundary run a line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor
and from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath. Then the boundary will go to Zedad
continue to Ziphron and end at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary on the north.
 For your eastern boundary run a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
The boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Kinnereth.
Then the boundary will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea.  This will be your land with its boundaries on every side. 
Moses commanded the Israelites Assign this land by lot as an inheritance. The Lord has ordered that it be given to the nine and a half tribes
because the families of the tribe of Reuben the tribe of Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan of Jericho toward the sunrise.
These are their names Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah
Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon
Elidad son of Kislon from the tribe of Benjamin
Bukki son of Jogli the leader from the tribe of Dan
Hanniel son of Ephod the leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph
Kemuel son of Shiphtan the leader from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph
Elizaphan son of Parnach the leader from the tribe of Zebulun
Paltiel son of Azzan the leader from the tribe of Issachar
Ahihud son of Shelomi the leader from the tribe of Asher
Pedahel son of Ammihud the leader from the tribe of Naphtali.
These are the men the Lord commanded to assign the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho the Lord said to Moses
Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. And give them pasturelands around the towns.
Then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for their cattle flocks and all their other livestock.
The pasturelands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend out fifteen hundred feet from the town wall.
Outside the town measure three thousand feet on the east side three thousand on the south side three thousand on the west and three thousand on the north with the town in the center. They will have this area as pastureland for the towns.
Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge to which a person who has killed someone may flee. In addition give them fortytwo other towns.
In all you must give the Levites fortyeight towns together with their pasturelands.
The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe Take many towns from a tribe that has many but few from one that has few.
Then the Lord said to Moses
Speak to the Israelites and say to them When you cross the Jordan into Canaan
select some towns to be your cities of refuge to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee.
They will be places of refuge from the avenger so that a person accused of murder may not die before he stands trial before the assembly.
The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir the son of Manasseh who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph came and spoke before Moses and the leaders the heads of the Israelite families.
They said When the Lord commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.
When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our forefathers.
Then at the Lords command Moses gave this order to the Israelites What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.
This is what the Lord commands for Zelophehads daughters They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father.
No inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe for every Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers.
Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her fathers tribal clan so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.
No inheritance may pass from tribe to tribe for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits.
So Zelophehads daughters did as the Lord commanded Moses.
Zelophehads daughtersMahlah Tirzah Hoglah Milcah and Noahmarried their cousins on their fathers side.
They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph and their inheritance remained in their fathers clan and tribe.
These are the commands and regulations the Lord gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the desert east of the Jordanthat is in the Arabahopposite Suph between Paran and Tophel Laban Hazeroth and Dizahab.

In the fortieth year on the first day of the eleventh month Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them.
This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth.
East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab Moses began to expound this law saying
The Lord our God said to us at Horeb You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah in the mountains in the western foothills in the Negev and along the coast to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon as far as the great river the Euphrates.
See I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the Lord swore he would give to your fathersto Abraham Isaac and Jacoband to their descendants after them.
At that time I said to you You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.
The Lord your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.
May the Lord the God of your fathers increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!
But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?
Choose some wise understanding and respected men from each of your tribes and I will set them over you.
You answered me What you propose to do is good.
So I took the leading men of your tribes wise and respected men and appointed them to have authority over youas commanders of thousands of hundreds of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.
And I charged your judges at that time Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly whether the case is between brother Israelites or between one of them and an alien.
Do not show partiality in judging hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of any man for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you and I will hear it.
And at that time I told you everything you were to do.
Then as the Lord our God commanded us we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.
Then I said to you You have reached the hill country of the Amorites which the Lord our God is giving us.
See the Lord your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the Lord the God of your fathers told you. Do not be afraid do not be discouraged.
Then all of you came to me and said Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.
The idea seemed good to me so I selected twelve of you one man from each tribe.
They left and went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.
Taking with them some of the fruit of the land they brought it down to us and reported It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.
But you were unwilling to go up you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God.
You grumbled in your tents and said The Lord hates us so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.
Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart. They say The people are stronger and taller than we are the cities are large with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there. 
Then I said to you Do not be terrified do not be afraid of them.
The Lord your God who is going before you will fight for you as he did for you in Egypt before your very eyes
and in the desert. There you saw how the Lord your God carried you as a father carries his son all the way you went until you reached this place.
In spite of this you did not trust in the Lord your God
who went ahead of you on your journey in fire by night and in a cloud by day to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.
When the Lord heard what you said he was angry and solemnly swore
Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers
except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on because he followed the Lord wholeheartedly.
Then we turned back and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea as the Lord had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.
Then the Lord said to me
You have made your way around this hill country long enough now turn north.
Give the people these orders You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of Esau who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you but be very careful.
Do not provoke them to war for I will not give you any of their land not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.
You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink. 
The Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you and you have not lacked anything.
So we went on past our brothers the descendants of Esau who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber and traveled along the desert road of Moab.
Then the Lord said to me Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.
(The Emites used to live therea people strong and numerous and as tall as the Anakites.
Like the Anakites they too were considered Rephaites but the Moabites called them Emites.
Horites used to live in Seir but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place just as Israel did in the land the Lord gave them as their possession.)
And the Lord said Now get up and cross the Zered Valley. So we crossed the valley.
Thirtyeight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp as the Lord had sworn to them.
The Lords hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.
Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died
the Lord said to me
Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.
When you come to the Ammonites do not harass them or provoke them to war for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.
(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites who used to live there but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
They were a people strong and numerous and as tall as the Anakites. The Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites who drove them out and settled in their place.
The Lord had done the same for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.
And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.)
Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.
This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.
From the desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying
Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot
Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
The Lord said to me Do not be afraid of him for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon.
So the Lord our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down leaving no survivors.
At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from themthe whole region of Argob Ogs kingdom in Bashan.
All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars and there were also a great many unwalled villages.
We completely destroyed them as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon destroying every citymen women and children.
But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.
So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.

We took all the towns on the plateau and all Gilead and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei towns of Ogs kingdom in Bashan.

Of the land that we took over at that time I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge including half the hill country of Gilead together with its towns.
The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan the kingdom of Og I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.
Jair a descendant of Manasseh took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites it was named after him so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.)
And I gave Gilead to Makir.
But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge  and out to the Jabbok River which is the border of the Ammonites.
Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah  below the slopes of Pisgah.
I commanded you at that time The Lord your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your ablebodied men armed for battle must cross over ahead of your brother Israelites.
However your wives your children and your livestock  may stay in the towns I have given you
until the Lord gives rest to your brothers as he has to you and they too have taken over the land that the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.
At that time I commanded Joshua You have seen with your own eyes all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.
Do not be afraid of them the Lord your God himself will fight for you.
At that time I pleaded with the Lord
O Sovereign Lord you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?
Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordanthat fine hill country and Lebanon.
But because of you the Lord was angry with me and would not listen to me. That is enough the Lord said. Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.
Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes since you are not going to cross this Jordan.
But commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.
So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
Hear now O Israel the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land that the Lord the God of your fathers is giving you.
Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you.
You saw with your own eyes what the Lord did at Baal Peor. The Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor
but all of you who held fast to the Lord your God are still alive today.
See I have taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it.
Observe them carefully for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations who will hear about all these decrees and say Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to him?
And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?
Only be careful and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.
Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb when he said to me Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children.
You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens with black clouds and deep darkness.
Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form there was only a voice.
He declared to you his covenant the Ten Commandments which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.
And the Lord directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
You saw no form of any kind the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully
so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol an image of any shape whether formed like a man or a woman
or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air
or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.
And when you look up to the sky and see the sun the moon and the starsall the heavenly arraydo not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.
But as for you the Lord took you and brought you out of the ironsmelting furnace out of Egypt to be the people of his inheritance as you now are.
The Lord was angry with me because of you and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.
I will die in this land I will not cross the Jordan but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.
Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made with you do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord your God has forbidden.
For the Lord your God is a consuming fire a jealous God.
After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long timeif you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and provoking him to anger
I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.
The Lord will scatter you among the peoples and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the Lord will drive you.
There you will worship manmade gods of wood and stone which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.
But if from there you seek the Lord your God you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul.
When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you then in later days you will return to the Lord your God and obey him.
For the Lord your God is a merciful God he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your forefathers which he confirmed to them by oath.
Ask now about the former days long before your time from the day God created man on the earth ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened or has anything like it ever been heard of?
Moses summoned all Israel and said Hear O Israel the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them.
The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
It was not with our fathers that the Lord made this covenant but with us with all of us who are alive here today.
The Lord spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
And he said
I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
You shall have no other gods before me.
You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
You shall not bow down to them or worship them for I the Lord your God am a jealous God punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me
but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy as the Lord your God has commanded you.
Six days you shall labor and do all your work
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work neither you nor your son or daughter nor your manservant or maidservant nor your ox your donkey or any of your animals nor the alien within your gates so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do.
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
Honor your father and your mother as the Lord your God has commanded you so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
You shall not murder.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbors wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbors house or land his manservant or maidservant his ox or donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
These are the commandments the Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire the cloud and the deep darkness and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
When you heard the voice out of the darkness while the mountain was ablaze with fire all the leading men of your tribes and your elders came to me.
And you said The Lord our God has shown us his glory and his majesty and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a man can live even if God speaks with him.
These are the commands decrees and laws the Lord your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess
so that you your children and their children after them may fear the Lord your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you and so that you may enjoy long life.
Hear O Israel and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey just as the Lord the God of your fathers promised you.
Hear O Israel The Lord our God the Lord is one.
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.
Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up.
Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
When the Lord your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give youa land with large flourishing cities you did not build
houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide wells you did not dig and vineyards and olive groves you did not plantthen when you eat and are satisfied
be careful that you do not forget the Lord who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
Fear the Lord your God serve him only and take your oaths in his name.
Do not follow other gods the gods of the peoples around you
for the Lord your God who is among you is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you and he will destroy you from the face of the land.
Do not test the Lord your God as you did at Massah.
Be sure to keep the commands of the Lord your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you.
Do what is right and good in the Lords sight so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land that the Lord promised on oath to your forefathers
thrusting out all your enemies before you as the Lord said.
In the future when your son asks you What is the meaning of the stipulations decrees and laws the Lord our God has commanded you?
tell him We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Before our eyes the Lord sent miraculous signs and wondersgreat and terribleupon Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household.
But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land that he promised on oath to our forefathers.
The Lord commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the Lord our God so that we might always prosper and be kept alive as is the case today.
And if we are careful to obey all this law before the Lord our God as he has commanded us that will be our righteousness.
When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nationsthe Hittites Girgashites Amorites Canaanites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites seven nations larger and stronger than you
and when the Lord your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy.
Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons
for they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods and the Lords anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you.
This is what you are to do to them Break down their altars smash their sacred stones cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire.
For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people his treasured possession.
The Lord did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples for you were the fewest of all peoples.
But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Know therefore that the Lord your God is God he is the faithful God keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands.
But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.
Therefore take care to follow the commands decrees and laws I give you today.
If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them then the Lord your God will keep his covenant of love with you as he swore to your forefathers.
He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb the crops of your landyour grain new wine and oilthe calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land that he swore to your forefathers to give you.
You will be blessed more than any other people none of your men or women will be childless nor any of your livestock without young.
The Lord will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt but he will inflict them on all who hate you.
You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods for that will be a snare to you.
You may say to yourselves These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?
But do not be afraid of them remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
You saw with your own eyes the great trials the miraculous signs and wonders the mighty hand and outstretched arm with which the Lord your God brought you out. The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.
Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land that the Lord promised on oath to your forefathers.
Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the desert these forty years to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in your heart whether or not you would keep his commands.
He humbled you causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna which neither you nor your fathers had known to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son so the Lord your God disciplines you.
Observe the commands of the Lord your God walking in his ways and revering him.
For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good landa land with streams and pools of water with springs flowing in the valleys and hills
a land with wheat and barley vines and fig trees pomegranates olive oil and honey
a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills.
When you have eaten and are satisfied praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.
Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God failing to observe his commands his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day.
Otherwise when you eat and are satisfied when you build fine houses and settle down
and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied
then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
He led you through the vast and dreadful desert that thirsty and waterless land with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock.
He gave you manna to eat in the desert something your fathers had never known to humble and to test you so that in the end it might go well with you.
You may say to yourself My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.
But remember the Lord your God for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth and so confirms his covenant which he swore to your forefathers as it is today.
If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.
Like the nations the Lord destroyed before you so you will be destroyed for not obeying the Lord your God.
Hear O Israel. You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you with large cities that have walls up to the sky.
The people are strong and tallAnakites! You know about them and have heard it said Who can stand up against the Anakites?
But be assured today that the Lord your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly as the Lord has promised you.
After the Lord your God has driven them out before you do not say to yourself The Lord has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness. No it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is going to drive them out before you.
It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land but on account of the wickedness of these nations the Lord your God will drive them out before you to accomplish what he swore to your fathers to Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
Understand then that it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess for you are a stiffnecked people.
Remember this and never forget how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the desert. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here you have been rebellious against the Lord.
At Horeb you aroused the Lords wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.
When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant that the Lord had made with you I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights I ate no bread and drank no water.
The Lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the Lord proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly.
At the end of the forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me the two stone tablets the tablets of the covenant.
Then the Lord told me Go down from here at once because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made a cast idol for themselves.
And the Lord said to me I have seen this people and they are a stiffnecked people indeed!
Let me alone so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.
So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
When I looked I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the Lord had commanded you.
So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands breaking them to pieces before your eyes.
Then once again I fell prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights I ate no bread and drank no water because of all the sin you had committed doing what was evil in the Lords sight and so provoking him to anger.
I feared the anger and wrath of the Lord for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the Lord listened to me.
And the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.
Also I took that sinful thing of yours the calf you had made and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.
At that time the Lord said to me Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden chest.
I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke. Then you are to put them in the chest.
So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me.
Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made as the Lord commanded me and they are there now.
(The Israelites traveled from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.
From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah a land with streams of water.
At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord to stand before the Lord to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name as they still do today.
That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their brothers the Lord is their inheritance as the Lord your God told them.)
Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and nights as I did the first time and the Lord listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you.
Go the Lord said to me and lead the people on their way so that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.
And now O Israel what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the Lord your God to walk in all his ways to love him to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
and to observe the Lords commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?
To the Lord your God belong the heavens even the highest heavens the earth and everything in it.
Yet the Lord set his affection on your forefathers and loved them and he chose you their descendants above all the nations as it is today.
Circumcise your hearts therefore and do not be stiffnecked any longer.
For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords the great God mighty and awesome who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.
He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow and loves the alien giving him food and clothing.
And you are to love those who are aliens for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt.
Fear the Lord your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.
He is your praise he is your God who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes.
Your forefathers who went down into Egypt were seventy in all and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Love the Lord your God and keep his requirements his decrees his laws and his commands always.
Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the Lord your God his majesty his mighty hand his outstretched arm
the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country
what he did to the Egyptian army to its horses and chariots how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea as they were pursuing you and how the Lord brought lasting ruin on them.
It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the desert until you arrived at this place
and what he did to Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab the Reubenite when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households their tents and every living thing that belonged to them.
But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the Lord has done.
Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess
and so that you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your forefathers to give to them and their descendants a land flowing with milk and honey.
The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden.
But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven.
It is a land the Lord your God cares for the eyes of the Lord your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.
So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you todayto love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
then I will send rain on your land in its season both autumn and spring rains so that you may gather in your grain new wine and oil.
I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle and you will eat and be satisfied.
Be careful or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them.
Then the Lords anger will burn against you and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce and you will soon perish from the good land the Lord is giving you.
Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
Teach them to your children talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up.
Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates
so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the Lord swore to give your forefathers as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth.
If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to followto love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and to hold fast to him
then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you.
Every place where you set your foot will be yours Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the Euphrates River to the western sea.
No man will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God as he promised you will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land wherever you go.
See I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse
the blessing if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today
the curse if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods which you have not known.
When the Lord your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings and on Mount Ebal the curses.
As you know these mountains are across the Jordan west of the road toward the setting sun near the great trees of Moreh in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal.
You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there
be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.
These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the Lord the God of your fathers has given you to possessas long as you live in the land.
Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains and on the hills and under every spreading tree where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods.
Break down their altars smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.
You must not worship the Lord your God in their way.
But you are to seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go
there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices your tithes and special gifts what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
There in the presence of the Lord your God you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to because the Lord your God has blessed you.
You are not to do as we do here today everyone as he sees fit
since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the Lord your God is giving you.
But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety.
Then to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his Namethere you are to bring everything I command you your burnt offerings and sacrifices your tithes and special gifts and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the Lord.
And there rejoice before the Lord your God you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own.
Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please.
Offer them only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes and there observe everything I command you.
Nevertheless you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want as if it were gazelle or deer according to the blessing the Lord your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.
But you must not eat the blood pour it out on the ground like water.
You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and oil or the firstborn of your herds and flocks or whatever you have vowed to give or your freewill offerings or special gifts.
If a prophet or one who foretells by dreams appears among you and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder
and if the sign or wonder of which he has spoken takes place and he says Let us follow other gods  and let us worship them
you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.
It is the Lord your God you must follow and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him serve him and hold fast to him.
That prophet or dreamer must be put to death because he preached rebellion against the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery he has tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you.
If your very own brother or your son or daughter or the wife you love or your closest friend secretly entices you saying Let us go and worship other gods (gods that neither you nor your fathers have known
gods of the peoples around you whether near or far from one end of the land to the other)
do not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity. Do not spare him or shield him.
You must certainly put him to death. Your hand must be the first in putting him to death and then the hands of all the people.
Stone him to death because he tried to turn you away from the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
Then all Israel will hear and be afraid and no one among you will do such an evil thing again.
You are the children of the Lord your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead
for you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth the Lord has chosen you to be his treasured possession.
Do not eat any detestable thing.
These are the animals you may eat the ox the sheep the goat
the deer the gazelle the roe deer the wild goat the ibex the antelope and the mountain sheep.
You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud.
However of those that chew the cud or that have a split hoof completely divided you may not eat the camel the rabbit or the coney. Although they chew the cud they do not have a split hoof they are ceremonially unclean for you.
The pig is also unclean although it has a split hoof it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
Of all the creatures living in the water you may eat any that has fins and scales.
But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat for you it is unclean.
You may eat any clean bird.
But these you may not eat the eagle the vulture the black vulture
the red kite the black kite any kind of falcon
any kind of raven
the horned owl the screech owl the gull any kind of hawk
the little owl the great owl the white owl
the desert owl the osprey the cormorant
the stork any kind of heron the hoopoe and the bat.
All flying insects that swarm are unclean to you do not eat them.
But any winged creature that is clean you may eat.
Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to an alien living in any of your towns and he may eat it or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mothers milk.
Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.
At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
This is how it is to be done Every creditor shall cancel the loan he has made to his fellow Israelite. He shall not require payment from his fellow Israelite or brother because the Lords time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.
You may require payment from a foreigner but you must cancel any debt your brother owes you.
However there should be no poor among you for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance he will richly bless you
if only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.
For the Lord your God will bless you as he has promised and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.
If there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother.
Rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs.
Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought The seventh year the year for canceling debts is near so that you do not show ill will toward your needy brother and give him nothing. He may then appeal to the Lord against you and you will be found guilty of sin.
Give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart then because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.
There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in your land.
If a fellow Hebrew a man or a woman sells himself to you and serves you six years in the seventh year you must let him go free.
And when you release him do not send him away emptyhanded.
Supply him liberally from your flock your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to him as the Lord your God has blessed you.
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.
But if your servant says to you I do not want to leave you because he loves you and your family and is well off with you
then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your maidservant.
Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free because his service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.
Set apart for the Lord your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your oxen to work and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.
Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he will choose.
If an animal has a defect is lame or blind or has any serious flaw you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover of the Lord your God because in the month of Abib he brought you out of Egypt by night.
Sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord your God an animal from your flock or herd at the place the Lord will choose as a dwelling for his Name.
Do not eat it with bread made with yeast but for seven days eat unleavened bread the bread of affliction because you left Egypt in hasteso that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt.
Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning.
You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the Lord your God gives you
except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening when the sun goes down on the anniversary of your departure from Egypt.
Roast it and eat it at the place the Lord your God will choose. Then in the morning return to your tents.
For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the Lord your God and do no work.
Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.
Then celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the Lord your God has given you.
And rejoice before the Lord your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Nameyou your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants the Levites in your towns and the aliens the fatherless and the widows living among you.
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and follow carefully these decrees.
Celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress.
Be joyful at your Feastyou your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the Levites the aliens the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns.
For seven days celebrate the Feast to the Lord your God at the place the Lord will choose. For the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands and your joy will be complete.
Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place he will choose at the Feast of Unleavened Bread the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles. No man should appear before the Lord emptyhanded
Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed you.
Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the Lord your God is giving you and they shall judge the people fairly.
Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.
Do not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect or flaw in it for that would be detestable to him.
If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the Lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God in violation of his covenant
and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars of the sky
and this has been brought to your attention then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel
take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death.
On the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death but no one shall be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting him to death and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you.
If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judgewhether bloodshed lawsuits or assaultstake them to the place the Lord your God will choose.
Go to the priests who are Levites and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict.
You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the Lord will choose. Be careful to do everything they direct you to do.
Act according to the law they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you to the right or to the left.
The man who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the Lord your God must be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel.
All the people will hear and be afraid and will not be contemptuous again.
When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it and you say Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us
be sure to appoint over you the king the Lord your God chooses. He must be from among your own brothers. Do not place a foreigner over you one who is not a brother Israelite.
The king moreover must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them for the Lord has told you You are not to go back that way again.
He must not take many wives or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
When he takes the throne of his kingdom he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law taken from that of the priests who are Levites.
It is to be with him and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the Lord his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees
and not consider himself better than his brothers and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
The priests who are Levitesindeed the whole tribe of Leviare to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the offerings made to the Lord by fire for that is their inheritance.
They shall have no inheritance among their brothers the Lord is their inheritance as he promised them.
This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep the shoulder the jowls and the inner parts.
You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain new wine and oil and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep
for the Lord your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the Lords name always.
If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living and comes in all earnestness to the place the Lord will choose
he may minister in the name of the Lord his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the Lord.
He is to share equally in their benefits even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions.
When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.
Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire who practices divination or sorcery interprets omens engages in witchcraft
or casts spells or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.
Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you.
You must be blameless before the Lord your God.
The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so.
The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.
For this is what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said Let us not hear the voice of the Lord our God nor see this great fire anymore or we will die.
The Lord said to me What they say is good.
I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers I will put my words in his mouth and he will tell them everything I command him.
If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name I myself will call him to account.
But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods must be put to death.
When the Lord your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses
then set aside for yourselves three cities centrally located in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
Build roads to them and divide into three parts the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance so that anyone who kills a man may flee there.
This is the rule concerning the man who kills another and flees there to save his lifeone who kills his neighbor unintentionally without malice aforethought.
For instance a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood and as he swings his ax to fell a tree the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life.
Otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage overtake him if the distance is too great and kill him even though he is not deserving of death since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought.
This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.
If the Lord your God enlarges your territory as he promised on oath to your forefathers and gives you the whole land he promised them
because you carefully follow all these laws I command you todayto love the Lord your God and to walk always in his waysthen you are to set aside three more cities.
Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land which the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.
But if a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him assaults and kills him and then flees to one of these cities
the elders of his town shall send for him bring him back from the city and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die.
Show him no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood so that it may go well with you.
Do not move your neighbors boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
One witness is not enough to convict a man accused of any crime or offense he may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse a man of a crime
the two men involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the Lord before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time.
The judges must make a thorough investigation and if the witness proves to be a liar giving false testimony against his brother
then do to him as he intended to do to his brother. You must purge the evil from among you.
When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours do not be afraid of them because the Lord your God who brought you up out of Egypt will be with you.
When you are about to go into battle the priest shall come forward and address the army.
He shall say Hear O Israel today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid do not be terrified or give way to panic before them.
For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.
The officers shall say to the army Has anyone built a new house and not dedicated it? Let him go home or he may die in battle and someone else may dedicate it.
Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it.
Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home or he may die in battle and someone else marry her.
Then the officers shall add Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his brothers will not become disheartened too.
When the officers have finished speaking to the army they shall appoint commanders over it.
When you march up to attack a city make its people an offer of peace.
If they accept and open their gates all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you.
If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle lay siege to that city.
When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand put to the sword all the men in it.
As for the women the children the livestock and everything else in the city you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies.
This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.
However in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance do not leave alive anything that breathes.
Completely destroy themthe Hittites Amorites Canaanites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusitesas the Lord your God has commanded you.
Otherwise they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods and you will sin against the Lord your God.
When you lay siege to a city for a long time fighting against it to capture it do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees of the field people that you should besiege them?
However you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.
If a man is found slain lying in a field in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess and it is not known who killed him
your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns.
Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke
and lead her down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifers neck.
The priests the sons of Levi shall step forward for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the Lord and to decide all cases of dispute and assault.
Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley
and they shall declare Our hands did not shed this blood nor did our eyes see it done.
Accept this atonement for your people Israel whom you have redeemed O Lord and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent man. And the bloodshed will be atoned for.
So you will purge from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood since you have done what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
When you go to war against your enemies and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives
if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her you may take her as your wife.
Bring her into your home and have her shave her head trim her nails
and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife.
If you are not pleased with her let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave since you have dishonored her.
If a man has two wives and he loves one but not the other and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love
when he wills his property to his sons he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn the son of the wife he does not love.
He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his fathers strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him
his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.
They shall say to the elders This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.
Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.
If a man guilty of a capital offense is put to death and his body is hung on a tree
you must not leave his body on the tree overnight. Be sure to bury him that same day because anyone who is hung on a tree is under Gods curse. You must not desecrate the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
If you see your brothers ox or sheep straying do not ignore it but be sure to take it back to him.
If the brother does not live near you or if you do not know who he is take it home with you and keep it until he comes looking for it. Then give it back to him.
Do the same if you find your brothers donkey or his cloak or anything he loses. Do not ignore it.
If you see your brothers donkey or his ox fallen on the road do not ignore it. Help him get it to its feet.
A woman must not wear mens clothing nor a man wear womens clothing for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this.
If you come across a birds nest beside the road either in a tree or on the ground and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs do not take the mother with the young.
You may take the young but be sure to let the mother go so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life.
When you build a new house make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof.
Do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard if you do not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled.
Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
If a man takes a wife and after lying with her dislikes her
and slanders her and gives her a bad name saying I married this woman but when I approached her I did not find proof of her virginity
then the girls father and mother shall bring proof that she was a virgin to the town elders at the gate.
The girls father will say to the elders I gave my daughter in marriage to this man but he dislikes her.
Now he has slandered her and said I did not find your daughter to be a virgin. But here is the proof of my daughters virginity. Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town
and the elders shall take the man and punish him.
They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the girls father because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife he must not divorce her as long as he lives.
If however the charge is true and no proof of the girls virginity can be found
she shall be brought to the door of her fathers house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her fathers house. You must purge the evil from among you.
If a man is found sleeping with another mans wife both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.
If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her
you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to deaththe girl because she was in a town and did not scream for help and the man because he violated another mans wife. You must purge the evil from among you.
No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the Lord.
No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord even down to the tenth generation.
No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord even down to the tenth generation.
For they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim to pronounce a curse on you.
However the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam but turned the curse into a blessing for you because the Lord your God loves you.
Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live.
Do not abhor an Edomite for he is your brother. Do not abhor an Egyptian because you lived as an alien in his country.
The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the Lord.
When you are encamped against your enemies keep away from everything impure.
If one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission he is to go outside the camp and stay there.
But as evening approaches he is to wash himself and at sunset he may return to the camp.
Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself.
As part of your equipment have something to dig with and when you relieve yourself dig a hole and cover up your excrement.
For the Lord your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you.
If a slave has taken refuge with you do not hand him over to his master.
Let him live among you wherever he likes and in whatever town he chooses. Do not oppress him.
No Israelite man or woman is to become a shrine prostitute.
You must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute or of a male prostitute into the house of the Lord your God to pay any vow because the Lord your God detests them both.
Do not charge your brother interest whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest.
You may charge a foreigner interest but not a brother Israelite so that the Lord your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess.
If you make a vow to the Lord your God do not be slow to pay it for the Lord your God will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin.
If a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her and he writes her a certificate of divorce gives it to her and sends her from his house
and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man
and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce gives it to her and sends her from his house or if he dies
then her first husband who divorced her is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the Lord. Do not bring sin upon the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
If a man has recently married he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.
Do not take a pair of millstonesnot even the upper oneas security for a debt because that would be taking a mans livelihood as security.
If a man is caught kidnapping one of his brother Israelites and treats him as a slave or sells him the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.
In cases of leprous diseases be very careful to do exactly as the priests who are Levites instruct you. You must follow carefully what I have commanded them.
Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam along the way after you came out of Egypt.
When you make a loan of any kind to your neighbor do not go into his house to get what he is offering as a pledge.
Stay outside and let the man to whom you are making the loan bring the pledge out to you.
If the man is poor do not go to sleep with his pledge in your possession.
Pay him his wages each day before sunset because he is poor and is counting on it. Otherwise he may cry to the Lord against you and you will be guilty of sin.
Fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children put to death for their fathers each is to die for his own sin.
Do not deprive the alien or the fatherless of justice or take the cloak of the widow as a pledge.
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you from there. That is why I command you to do this.
When men have a dispute they are to take it to court and the judges will decide the case acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty.
If the guilty man deserves to be beaten the judge shall make him lie down and have him flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his crime deserves
but he must not give him more than forty lashes. If he is flogged more than that your brother will be degraded in your eyes.
Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.
If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husbands brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brotherinlaw to her.
The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
However if a man does not want to marry his brothers wife she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say My husbands brother refuses to carry on his brothers name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brotherinlaw to me.
Then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying I do not want to marry her
his brothers widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders take off one of his sandals spit in his face and say This is what is done to the man who will not build up his brothers family line.
That mans line shall be known in Israel as The Family of the Unsandaled.
If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts
you shall cut off her hand. Show her no pity.
Do not have two differing weights in your bagone heavy one light.
Do not have two differing measures in your houseone large one small.
You must have accurate and honest weights and measures so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
For the Lord your God detests anyone who does these things anyone who deals dishonestly.
Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt.
When you were weary and worn out they met you on your journey and cut off all who were lagging behind they had no fear of God.
When the Lord your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!
When you have entered the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it
take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the Lord your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name
and say to the priest in office at the time I declare today to the Lord your God that I have come to the land the Lord swore to our forefathers to give us.
The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the Lord your God.
Then you shall declare before the Lord your God My father was a wandering Aramean and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation powerful and numerous.
But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer putting us to hard labor.
Then we cried out to the Lord the God of our fathers and the Lord heard our voice and saw our misery toil and oppression.
So the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm with great terror and with miraculous signs and wonders.
He brought us to this place and gave us this land a land flowing with milk and honey
and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you O Lord have given me. Place the basket before the Lord your God and bow down before him.
And you and the Levites and the aliens among you shall rejoice in all the good things the Lord your God has given to you and your household.
When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year the year of the tithe you shall give it to the Levite the alien the fatherless and the widow so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.
Then say to the Lord your God I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite the alien the fatherless and the widow according to all you commanded. I have not turned aside from your commands nor have I forgotten any of them.
I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the Lord my God I have done everything you commanded me.
Look down from heaven your holy dwelling place and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our forefathers a land flowing with milk and honey.
The Lord your God commands you this day to follow these decrees and laws carefully observe them with all your heart and with all your soul.
You have declared this day that the Lord is your God and that you will walk in his ways that you will keep his decrees commands and laws and that you will obey him.
And the Lord has declared this day that you are his people his treasured possession as he promised and that you are to keep all his commands.
He has declared that he will set you in praise fame and honor high above all the nations he has made and that you will be a people holy to the Lord your God as he promised.
Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people Keep all these commands that I give you today.
When you have crossed the Jordan into the land the Lord your God is giving you set up some large stones and coat them with plaster.
Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you a land flowing with milk and honey just as the Lord the God of your fathers promised you.
And when you have crossed the Jordan set up these stones on Mount Ebal as I command you today and coat them with plaster.
Build there an altar to the Lord your God an altar of stones. Do not use any iron tool upon them.
Build the altar of the Lord your God with fieldstones and offer burnt offerings on it to the Lord your God.
Sacrifice fellowship offerings there eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the Lord your God.
And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up.
Then Moses and the priests who are Levites said to all Israel Be silent O Israel and listen! You have now become the people of the Lord your God.
Obey the Lord your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today.
On the same day Moses commanded the people
When you have crossed the Jordan these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people Simeon Levi Judah Issachar Joseph and Benjamin.
And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses Reuben Gad Asher Zebulun Dan and Naphtali.
The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice
Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idola thing detestable to the Lord the work of the craftsmans handsand sets it up in secret. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who moves his neighbors boundary stone. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the road. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien the fatherless or the widow. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who sleeps with his fathers wife for he dishonors his fathers bed. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who has sexual relations with any animal. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who sleeps with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who sleeps with his motherinlaw. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who kills his neighbor secretly. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. Then all the people shall say Amen!
Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out. Then all the people shall say Amen!
If you fully obey the Lord your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations on earth.
All these blessings will come upon you and accompany you if you obey the Lord your God
You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.
The fruit of your womb will be blessed and the crops of your land and the young of your livestockthe calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.

The Lord will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The Lord your God will bless you in the land he is giving you.
The Lord will establish you as his holy people as he promised you on oath if you keep the commands of the Lord your God and walk in his ways.
Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the Lord and they will fear you.
The Lord will grant you abundant prosperityin the fruit of your womb the young of your livestock and the crops of your groundin the land he swore to your forefathers to give you.
The Lord will open the heavens the storehouse of his bounty to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none.
The Lord will make you the head not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the Lord your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them you will always be at the top never at the bottom.
You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.
Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.
The fruit of your womb will be cursed and the crops of your land and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
The Lord will send on you curses confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.
The Lord will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess.
The Lord will strike you with wasting disease with fever and inflammation with scorching heat and drought with blight and mildew which will plague you until you perish.
The sky over your head will be bronze the ground beneath you iron.
The Lord will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed.
The Lord will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth.

The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors festering sores and the itch from which you cannot be cured.
The Lord will afflict you with madness blindness and confusion of mind.
These are the terms of the covenant the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb.
Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them Your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh to all his officials and to all his land.
With your own eyes you saw those great trials those miraculous signs and great wonders.
But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear.
During the forty years that I led you through the desert your clothes did not wear out nor did the sandals on your feet.
You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the Lord your God.
When you reached this place Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us but we defeated them.
We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh.
Carefully follow the terms of this covenant so that you may prosper in everything you do.
All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your Godyour leaders and chief men your elders and officials and all the other men of Israel
together with your children and your wives and the aliens living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water.
You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God a covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath
to confirm you this day as his people that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
I am making this covenant with its oath not only with you
who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God but also with those who are not here today.
You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here.
You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone of silver and gold.
Make sure there is no man or woman clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.
When such a person hears the words of this oath he invokes a blessing on himself and therefore thinks I will be safe even though I persist in going my own way. This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.
When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations
and when you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today
then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you.
Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back.
He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers.
The Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul and live.
The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you.
You will again obey the Lord and follow all his commands I am giving you today.
Then the Lord your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb the young of your livestock and the crops of your land. The Lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous just as he delighted in your fathers
if you obey the Lord your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.
It is not up in heaven so that you have to ask Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?
Nor is it beyond the sea so that you have to ask Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?
No the word is very near you it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.
See I set before you today life and prosperity death and destruction.
For I command you today to love the Lord your God to walk in his ways and to keep his commands decrees and laws then you will live and increase and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.
But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them
I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death blessings and curses. Now choose life so that you and your children may live
and that you may love the Lord your God listen to his voice and hold fast to him. For the Lord is your life and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob.
Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel
I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The Lord has said to me You shall not cross the Jordan.
The Lord your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you as the Lord said.
And the Lord will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og the kings of the Amorites whom he destroyed along with their land.
The Lord will deliver them to you and you must do to them all that I have commanded you.
Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them for the Lord your God goes with you he will never leave you nor forsake you.
Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel Be strong and courageous for you must go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to their forefathers to give them and you must divide it among them as their inheritance.
The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid do not be discouraged.
So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord and to all the elders of Israel.
Then Moses commanded them At the end of every seven years in the year for canceling debts during the Feast of Tabernacles
when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place he will choose you shall read this law before them in their hearing.
Assemble the peoplemen women and children and the aliens living in your townsso they can listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.
Their children who do not know this law must hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
The Lord said to Moses Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting where I will commission him. So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.
Then the Lord appeared at the Tent in a pillar of cloud and the cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent.
And the Lord said to Moses You are going to rest with your fathers and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.
On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them I will hide my face from them and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and difficulties will come upon them and on that day they will ask Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?
And I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.
Now write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it so that it may be a witness for me against them.
When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey the land I promised on oath to their forefathers and when they eat their fill and thrive they will turn to other gods and worship them rejecting me and breaking my covenant.
And when many disasters and difficulties come upon them this song will testify against them because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath.
So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.
The Lord gave this command to Joshua son of Nun Be strong and courageous for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath and I myself will be with you.
After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end
he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord
Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.
For I know how rebellious and stiffnecked you are. If you have been rebellious against the Lord while I am still alive and with you how much more will you rebel after I die!
Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them.
For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and provoke him to anger by what your hands have made.
And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel
Listen O heavens and I will speak hear O earth the words of my mouth.
Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew like showers on new grass like abundant rain on tender plants.
I will proclaim the name of the Lord. Oh praise the greatness of our God!
He is the Rock his works are perfect and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong upright and just is he.
They have acted corruptly toward him to their shame they are no longer his children but a warped and crooked generation.
Is this the way you repay the Lord O foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father your Creator who made you and formed you?
Remember the days of old consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you your elders and they will explain to you.
When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance when he divided all mankind he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.
For the Lords portion is his people Jacob his allotted inheritance.
In a desert land he found him in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him he guarded him as the apple of his eye
like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions.
The Lord alone led him no foreign god was with him.
He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock and with oil from the flinty crag
with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape.
Jeshurun grew fat and kicked filled with food he became heavy and sleek. He abandoned the God who made him and rejected the Rock his Savior.
They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols.
They sacrificed to demons which are not God gods they had not known gods that recently appeared gods your fathers did not fear.
You deserted the Rock who fathered you you forgot the God who gave you birth.
The Lord saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters.
I will hide my face from them he said and see what their end will be for they are a perverse generation children who are unfaithful.
They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.
For a fire has been kindled by my wrath one that burns to the realm of death below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains.
I will heap calamities upon them and spend my arrows against them.
I will send wasting famine against them consuming pestilence and deadly plague I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.
In the street the sword will make them childless in their homes terror will reign. Young men and young women will perish infants and grayhaired men.
I said I would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind
but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy lest the adversary misunderstand and say Our hand has triumphed the Lord has not done all this. 
They are a nation without sense there is no discernment in them.
This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.
He said The Lord came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south from his mountain slopes.
Surely it is you who love the people all the holy ones are in your hand. At your feet they all bow down and from you receive instruction
the law that Moses gave us the possession of the assembly of Jacob.
He was king over Jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled along with the tribes of Israel.
Let Reuben live and not die nor his men be few.
And this he said about Judah Hear O Lord the cry of Judah bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause. Oh be his help against his foes!
About Levi he said Your Thummim and Urim belong to the man you favored. You tested him at Massah you contended with him at the waters of Meribah.
He said of his father and mother I have no regard for them. He did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant.
He teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel. He offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
Bless all his skills O Lord and be pleased with the work of his hands. Smite the loins of those who rise up against him strike his foes till they rise no more.
Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah across from Jericho. There the Lord showed him the whole landfrom Gilead to Dan
all of Naphtali the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh all the land of Judah as far as the western sea
the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho the City of Palms as far as Zoar.
Then the Lord said to him This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham Isaac and Jacob when I said I will give it to your descendants. I have let you see it with your eyes but you will not cross over into it.
And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in Moab as the Lord had said.
He buried him in Moab in the valley opposite Beth Peor but to this day no one knows where his grave is.
Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.
The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days until the time of weeping and mourning was over.
Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the Lord had commanded Moses.
Since then no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses whom the Lord knew face to face
who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the Lord sent him to do in Egyptto Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.
For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun Moses aide
Moses my servant is dead. Now then you and all these people get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to themto the Israelites.
I will give you every place where you set your foot as I promised Moses.
Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the great river the Euphratesall the Hittite countryto the Great Sea on the west.
No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses so I will be with you I will never leave you nor forsake you.
Be strong and courageous because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.
Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you do not turn from it to the right or to the left that you may be successful wherever you go.
Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.
Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
So Joshua ordered the officers of the people
Go through the camp and tell the people Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you for your own. 
But to the Reubenites the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh Joshua said
Remember the command that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you The Lord your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.
Your wives your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan but all your fighting men fully armed must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers
until the Lord gives them rest as he has done for you and until they too have taken possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them. After that you may go back and occupy your own land which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.
Then they answered Joshua Whatever you have commanded us we will do and wherever you send us we will go.
Just as we fully obeyed Moses so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.
Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words whatever you may command them will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!
Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. Go look over the land he said especially Jericho. So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
The king of Jericho was told Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.
So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house because they have come to spy out the whole land.
But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said Yes the men came to me but I did not know where they had come from.
At dusk when it was time to close the city gate the men left. I dont know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.

So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan and as soon as the pursuers had gone out the gate was shut.
Before the spies lay down for the night she went up on the roof
and said to them I know that the Lord has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.
We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to Sihon and Og the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan whom you completely destroyed.
When we heard of it our hearts melted and everyones courage failed because of you for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.
Now then please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign
that you will spare the lives of my father and mother my brothers and sisters and all who belong to them and that you will save us from death.
Our lives for your lives! the men assured her. If you dont tell what we are doing we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land.
So she let them down by a rope through the window for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.
Now she had said to them Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return and then go on your way.
Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan where they camped before crossing over.
After three days the officers went throughout the camp
giving orders to the people When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God and the priests who are Levites carrying it you are to move out from your positions and follow it.
Then you will know which way to go since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards between you and the ark do not go near it.
Joshua told the people Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you.
Joshua said to the priests Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people. So they took it up and went ahead of them.
And the Lord said to Joshua Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.
Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant When you reach the edge of the Jordans waters go and stand in the river. 
Joshua said to the Israelites Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God.
This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites Hittites Hivites Perizzites Girgashites Amorites and Jebusites.
See the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.
Now then choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel one from each tribe.
And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the Lordthe Lord of all the earthset foot in the Jordan its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.
So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the waters edge
the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah  was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.
When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan the Lord said to Joshua
Choose twelve men from among the people one from each tribe
and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight.
to serve as a sign among you. In the future when your children ask you What do these stones mean?
tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it crossed the Jordan the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.
So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites as the Lord had told Joshua and they carried them over with them to their camp where they put them down.
Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.
Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua was done by the people just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over
and as soon as all of them had crossed the ark of the Lord and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.
The men of Reuben Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh crossed over armed in front of the Israelites as Moses had directed them.
About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the Lord to the plains of Jericho for war.
That day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel and they revered him all the days of his life just as they had revered Moses.
Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the Lord had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.
At that time the Lord said to Joshua Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again.
So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.
Now this is why he did so All those who came out of Egyptall the men of military agedied in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.
All the people that came out had been circumcised but all the people born in the desert during the journey from Egypt had not.
The Israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died since they had not obeyed the Lord. For the Lord had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey.
So he raised up their sons in their place and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.
And after the whole nation had been circumcised they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.
Then the Lord said to Joshua Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. So the place has been called Gilgal to this day.
On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho the Israelites celebrated the Passover.
The day after the Passover that very day they ate some of the produce of the land unleavened bread and roasted grain.
The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land there was no longer any manna for the Israelites but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan.
Now when Joshua was near Jericho he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked Are you for us or for our enemies?
Neither he replied but as commander of the army of the Lord I have now come. Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence and asked him What message does my Lord have for his servant?
The commander of the Lords army replied Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy. And Joshua did so.
Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.
Then the Lord said to Joshua See I have delivered Jericho into your hands along with its king and its fighting men.
March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days.
Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day march around the city seven times with the priests blowing the trumpets.
When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets have all the people give a loud shout then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up every man straight in.
So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it.
And he ordered the people Advance! March around the city with the armed guard going ahead of the ark of the Lord.
When Joshua had spoken to the people the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the Lord went forward blowing their trumpets and the ark of the Lords covenant followed them.
The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.
But Joshua had commanded the people Do not give a war cry do not raise your voices do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!
So he had the ark of the Lord carried around the city circling it once. Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there.
Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.
The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward marching before the ark of the Lord and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the Lord while the trumpets kept sounding.
So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
On the seventh day they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner except that on that day they circled the city seven times.
The seventh time around when the priests sounded the trumpet blast Joshua commanded the people Shout! For the Lord has given you the city!
The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the Lord. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared because she hid the spies we sent.
But keep away from the devoted things so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.
All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the Lord and must go into his treasury.
When the trumpets sounded the people shouted and at the sound of the trumpet when the people gave a loud shout the wall collapsed so every man charged straight in and they took the city.
They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in itmen and women young and old cattle sheep and donkeys.
Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land Go into the prostitutes house and bring her out and all who belong to her in accordance with your oath to her.
So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.
Then they burned the whole city and everything in it but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the Lords house.
But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute with her family and all who belonged to her because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jerichoand she lives among the Israelites to this day.
But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things Achan son of Carmi the son of Zimri the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah took some of them. So the Lords anger burned against Israel.
Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel and told them Go up and spy out the region. So the men went up and spied out Ai.
When they returned to Joshua they said Not all the people will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary all the people for only a few men are there.
So about three thousand men went up but they were routed by the men of Ai
who killed about thirtysix of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the Lord remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same and sprinkled dust on their heads.
And Joshua said Ah Sovereign Lord why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
O Lord what can I say now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?
The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?
The Lord said to Joshua Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?
Israel has sinned they have violated my covenant which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things they have stolen they have lied they have put them with their own possessions.
That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
Go consecrate the people. Tell them Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow for this is what the Lord the God of Israel says That which is devoted is among you O Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove it.
 In the morning present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the Lord takes shall come forward clan by clan the clan that the Lord takes shall come forward family by family and the family that the Lord takes shall come forward man by man.
He who is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the Lord and has done a disgraceful thing in Israel! 
Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes and Judah was taken.
The clans of Judah came forward and he took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families and Zimri was taken.
Joshua had his family come forward man by man and Achan son of Carmi the son of Zimri the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was taken.
Then Joshua said to Achan My son give glory to the Lord the God of Israel and give him the praise. Tell me what you have done do not hide it from me.
Achan replied It is true! I have sinned against the Lord the God of Israel. This is what I have done
When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent with the silver underneath.
So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and there it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
They took the things from the tent brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the Lord.
Then Joshua together with all Israel took Achan son of Zerah the silver the robe the gold wedge his sons and daughters his cattle donkeys and sheep his tent and all that he had to the Valley of Achor.
Joshua said Why have you brought this trouble on us? The Lord will bring trouble on you today. Then all Israel stoned him and after they had stoned the rest they burned them.
Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks which remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.
Then the Lord said to Joshua Do not be afraid do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai his people his city and his land.
You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.
So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night
with these orders Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Dont go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.
I and all those with me will advance on the city and when the men come out against us as they did before we will flee from them.
They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city for they will say They are running away from us as they did before. So when we flee from them
you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The Lord your God will give it into your hand.
When you have taken the city set it on fire. Do what the Lord has commanded. See to it you have my orders.
Then Joshua sent them off and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai to the west of Aibut Joshua spent that night with the people.
Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai.
The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai with the valley between them and the city.
Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai to the west of the city.
They had the soldiers take up their positionsall those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.
When the king of Ai saw this he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.
Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them and they fled toward the desert.
All the men of Ai were called to pursue them and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.
Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.
Then the Lord said to Joshua Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand for into your hand I will deliver the city. So Joshua held out his javelin toward Ai.
As soon as he did this the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.
The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky but they had no chance to escape in any direction for the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers.
For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.
The men of the ambush also came out of the city against them so that they were caught in the middle with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.
But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them and when every one of them had been put to the sword all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.
Twelve thousand men and women fell that dayall the people of Ai.
For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai.
Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these thingsthose in the hill country in the western foothills and along the entire coast of the Great Sea as far as Lebanon 
they came together to make war against Joshua and Israel.
However when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai
they resorted to a ruse They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with wornout sacks and old wineskins cracked and mended.
The men put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.
Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel We have come from a distant country make a treaty with us.
The men of Israel said to the Hivites But perhaps you live near us. How then can we make a treaty with you?
We are your servants they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked Who are you and where do you come from?
They answered Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the Lord your God. For we have heard reports of him all that he did in Egypt
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the JordanSihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth.
And our elders and all those living in our country said to us Take provisions for your journey go and meet them and say to them We are your servants make a treaty with us. 
This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is.
And these wineskins that we filled were new but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.
The men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the Lord.
Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.
Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites the Israelites heard that they were neighbors living near them.
So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities Gibeon Kephirah Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.
But the Israelites did not attack them because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the Lord the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders
but all the leaders answered We have given them our oath by the Lord the God of Israel and we cannot touch them now.
This is what we will do to them We will let them live so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them.
They continued Let them live but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community. So the leaders promise to them was kept.
Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said Why did you deceive us by saying We live a long way from you while actually you live near us?
You are now under a curse You will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.
They answered Joshua Your servants were clearly told how the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you and that is why we did this.
We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.
So Joshua saved them from the Israelites and they did not kill them.
That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the Lord at the place the Lord would choose. And that is what they are to this day.
Now AdoniZedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.
He and his people were very much alarmed at this because Gibeon was an important city like one of the royal cities it was larger than Ai and all its men were good fighters.
So AdoniZedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron Piram king of Jarmuth Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.
Come up and help me attack Gibeon he said because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.
Then the five kings of the Amoritesthe kings of Jerusalem Hebron Jarmuth Lachish and Eglonjoined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.
The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.
So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army including all the best fighting men.
The Lord said to Joshua Do not be afraid of them I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you.
After an allnight march from Gilgal Joshua took them by surprise.
The Lord threw them into confusion before Israel who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah the Lord hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.
On the day the Lord gave the Amorites over to Israel Joshua said to the Lord in the presence of Israel O sun stand still over Gibeon O moon over the Valley of Aijalon.
So the sun stood still and the moon stopped till the nation avenged itself on its enemies as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.
There has never been a day like it before or since a day when the Lord listened to a man. Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel!
Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
But dont stop! Pursue your enemies attack them from the rear and dont let them reach their cities for the Lord your God has given them into your hand.
So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completelyalmost to a manbut the few who were left reached their fortified cities.
The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.
Joshua said Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.
When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this he sent word to Jobab king of Madon to the kings of Shimron and Acshaph
and to the northern kings who were in the mountains in the Arabah south of Kinnereth in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west
to the Canaanites in the east and west to the Amorites Hittites Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah.
They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariotsa huge army as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
The Lord said to Joshua Do not be afraid of them because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them over to Israel slain. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.
So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them
and the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon to Misrephoth Maim and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east until no survivors were left.
Joshua did to them as the Lord had directed He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.
At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword.
Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed them not sparing anything that breathed and he burned up Hazor itself.
Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded.
Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their moundsexcept Hazor which Joshua burned.
The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them not sparing anyone that breathed.
As the Lord commanded his servant Moses so Moses commanded Joshua and Joshua did it he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses.
So Joshua took this entire land the hill country all the Negev the whole region of Goshen the western foothills the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills
from Mount Halak which rises toward Seir to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down putting them to death.
Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time.
Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites who took them all in battle.
For it was the Lord himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel so that he might destroy them totally exterminating them without mercy as the Lord had commanded Moses.
At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country from Hebron Debir and Anab from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns.
No Anakites were left in Israelite territory only in Gaza Gath and Ashdod did any survive.
So Joshua took the entire land just as the Lord had directed Moses and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war.
These are the kings of the land whom the Israelites had defeated and whose territory they took over east of the Jordan from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon including all the eastern side of the Arabah
Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorgefrom the middle of the gorgeto the Jabbok River which is the border of the Ammonites. This included half of Gilead.
He also ruled over the eastern Arabah from the Sea of Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah  to Beth Jeshimoth and then southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
And the territory of Og king of Bashan one of the last of the Rephaites who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
He ruled over Mount Hermon Salecah all of Bashan to the border of the people of Geshur and Maacah and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Moses the servant of the Lord and the Israelites conquered them. And Moses the servant of the Lord gave their land to the Reubenites the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh to be their possession.
These are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered on the west side of the Jordan from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak which rises toward Seir (their lands Joshua gave as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their tribal divisions
the hill country the western foothills the Arabah the mountain slopes the desert and the Negevthe lands of the Hittites Amorites Canaanites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites)
the king of Jericho one the king of Ai  one
the king of Jerusalem one the king of Hebron one
the king of Jarmuth one the king of Lachish one
the king of Eglon one the king of Gezer one
the king of Debir one the king of Geder one
the king of Hormah one the king of Arad one
the king of Libnah one the king of Adullam one
the king of Makkedah one the king of Bethel one
the king of Tappuah one the king of Hepher one
the king of Aphek one the king of Lasharon one
the king of Madon one the king of Hazor one
the king of Shimron Meron one the king of Acshaph one
the king of Taanach one the king of Megiddo one
the king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam in Carmel one
the king of Dor  one the king of Goyim in Gilgal one
the king of Tirzah one thirtyone kings in all.
When Joshua was old and well advanced in years the Lord said to him You are very old and there are still very large areas of land to be taken over.
This is the land that remains all the regions of the Philistines and Geshurites
the area of the Gebalites and all Lebanon to the east from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim that is all the Sidonians I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance as I have instructed you
and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
The other half of Manasseh the Reubenites and the Gadites had received the inheritance that Moses had given them east of the Jordan as he the servant of the Lord had assigned it to them.
It extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge and from the town in the middle of the gorge and included the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon
and all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon out to the border of the Ammonites.
It also included Gilead the territory of the people of Geshur and Maacah all of Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salecah
that is the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei and had survived as one of the last of the Rephaites. Moses had defeated them and taken over their land.
But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.
But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance since the offerings made by fire to the Lord the God of Israel are their inheritance as he promised them.
Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan which Eleazar the priest Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them.
Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nineandahalf tribes as the Lord had commanded through Moses.
Moses had granted the twoandahalf tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest
for the sons of Joseph had become two tribesManasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.
So the Israelites divided the land just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Now the men of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him You know what the Lord said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions
but my brothers who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear. I however followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.
So on that day Moses swore to me The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever because you have followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.
Now then just as the Lord promised he has kept me alive for fortyfive years since the time he said this to Moses while Israel moved about in the desert. So here I am today eightyfive years old!
I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out Im just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.
Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified but the Lord helping me I will drive them out just as he said.
Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since because he followed the Lord the God of Israel wholeheartedly.
Then the land had rest from war.
The allotment for the tribe of Judah clan by clan extended down to the territory of Edom to the Desert of Zin in the extreme south.
Their southern boundary started from the bay at the southern end of the Salt Sea
crossed south of Scorpion Pass continued on to Zin and went over to the south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran past Hezron up to Addar and curved around to Karka.
It then passed along to Azmon and joined the Wadi of Egypt ending at the sea. This is their southern boundary.
The eastern boundary is the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan
went up to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north to Gilgal which faces the Pass of Adummim south of the gorge. It continued along to the waters of En Shemesh and came out at En Rogel.
Then it ran up the Valley of Ben Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city . From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
From the hilltop the boundary headed toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah came out at the towns of Mount Ephron and went down toward Baalah .
The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan of Jericho east of the waters of Jericho and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.
It went on from Bethel  crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth
descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer ending at the sea.
So Manasseh and Ephraim the descendants of Joseph received their inheritance.
This was the territory of Ephraim clan by clan The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon
and continued to the sea. From Micmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh passing by it to Janoah on the east.
Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.
From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites clan by clan.
It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.
They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.
This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Josephs firstborn that is for Makir Manassehs firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites who had received Gilead and Bashan because the Makirites were great soldiers.
So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manassehthe clans of Abiezer Helek Asriel Shechem Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.
Now Zelophehad son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of Makir the son of Manasseh had no sons but only daughters whose names were Mahlah Noah Hoglah Milcah and Tirzah.
They went to Eleazar the priest Joshua son of Nun and the leaders and said The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. So Joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father according to the Lords command.
Manassehs share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan
because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.
The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Micmethath east of Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah.

Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the sea.
On the south the land belonged to Ephraim on the north to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
Within Issachar and Asher Manasseh also had Beth Shan Ibleam and the people of Dor Endor Taanach and Megiddo together with their surrounding settlements .
Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region.
However when the Israelites grew stronger they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely.
The people of Joseph said to Joshua Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people and the Lord has blessed us abundantly.
If you are so numerous Joshua answered and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites.
The people of Joseph replied The hill country is not enough for us and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have iron chariots both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel.
But Joshua said to the house of Josephto Ephraim and ManassehYou are numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment
but the forested hill country as well. Clear it and its farthest limits will be yours though the Canaanites have iron chariots and though they are strong you can drive them out.
The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The country was brought under their control
but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.
So Joshua said to the Israelites How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the Lord the God of your fathers has given you?
Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me.
You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the house of Joseph in its territory on the north.
After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the Lord our God.
The Levites however do not get a portion among you because the priestly service of the Lord is their inheritance. And Gad Reuben and the halftribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the Lord gave it to them.
As the men started on their way to map out the land Joshua instructed them Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord.
So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll town by town in seven parts and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the Lord and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions.
The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin clan by clan. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph
On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country coming out at the desert of Beth Aven.
From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz  and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.
From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal  a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side.
The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel.
It then curved north went to En Shemesh continued to Geliloth which faces the Pass of Adummim and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah and on down into the Arabah.
It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary.
The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides.
The tribe of Benjamin clan by clan had the following cities Jericho Beth Hoglah Emek Keziz
Beth Arabah Zemaraim Bethel
Avvim Parah Ophrah
Kephar Ammoni Ophni and Gebatwelve towns and their villages.
Gibeon Ramah Beeroth
Mizpah Kephirah Mozah
Rekem Irpeel Taralah
Zelah Haeleph the Jebusite city  Gibeah and Kiriathfourteen towns and their villages. This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its clans.
The second lot came out for the tribe of Simeon clan by clan. Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah.
It included Beersheba  Moladah
Hazar Shual Balah Ezem
Eltolad Bethul Hormah
Ziklag Beth Marcaboth Hazar Susah
Beth Lebaoth and Sharuhenthirteen towns and their villages
Ain Rimmon Ether and Ashanfour towns and their villages
and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath Beer . This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Simeonites clan by clan.
Then the Lord said to Joshua
Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge as I instructed you through Moses
so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood.
When he flees to one of these cities he is to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state his case before the elders of that city. Then they are to admit him into their city and give him a place to live with them.
If the avenger of blood pursues him they must not surrender the one accused because he killed his neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought.
He is to stay in that city until he has stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then he may go back to his own home in the town from which he fled.
So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and Kiriath Arba  in the hill country of Judah.
On the east side of the Jordan of Jericho they designated Bezer in the desert on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh.
Any of the Israelites or any alien living among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.
Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the other tribal families of Israel
at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them The Lord commanded through Moses that you give us towns to live in with pasturelands for our livestock.
So as the Lord had commanded the Israelites gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own inheritance
The first lot came out for the Kohathites clan by clan. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah Simeon and Benjamin.
The rest of Kohaths descendants were allotted ten towns from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim Dan and half of Manasseh.
From the tribes of Judah and Simeon they allotted the following towns by name

They gave them Kiriath Arba  with its surrounding pastureland in the hill country of Judah.
But the fields and villages around the city they had given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron  Libnah
Jattir Eshtemoa
Holon Debir
Ain Juttah and Beth Shemesh together with their pasturelandsnine towns from these two tribes.
And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon Geba
Anathoth and Almon together with their pasturelandsfour towns.
All the towns for the priests the descendants of Aaron were thirteen together with their pasturelands.
The rest of the Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted towns from the tribe of Ephraim
In the hill country of Ephraim they were given Shechem  and Gezer
Kibzaim and Beth Horon together with their pasturelandsfour towns.
Also from the tribe of Dan they received Eltekeh Gibbethon
Aijalon and Gath Rimmon together with their pasturelandsfour towns.
From half the tribe of Manasseh they received Taanach and Gath Rimmon together with their pasturelandstwo towns.
All these ten towns and their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans.
The Levite clans of the Gershonites were given from the halftribe of Manasseh Golan in Bashan  and Be Eshtarah together with their pasturelandstwo towns
from the tribe of Issachar Kishion Daberath
Jarmuth and En Gannim together with their pasturelandsfour towns
from the tribe of Asher Mishal Abdon
Helkath and Rehob together with their pasturelandsfour towns
from the tribe of Naphtali Kedesh in Galilee  Hammoth Dor and Kartan together with their pasturelandsthree towns.
All the towns of the Gershonite clans were thirteen together with their pasturelands.
Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh
and said to them You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded.
For a long time nowto this very dayyou have not deserted your brothers but have carried out the mission the Lord your God gave you.
Now that the Lord your God has given your brothers rest as he promised return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan.
But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways to obey his commands to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul.
Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went to their homes.
When Joshua sent them home he blessed them
saying Return to your homes with your great wealthwith large herds of livestock with silver gold bronze and iron and a great quantity of clothingand divide with your brothers the plunder from your enemies.
So the Reubenites the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead their own land which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the Lord through Moses.
When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan the Reubenites the Gadites and the halftribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.
And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side
the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.
So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the land of Gileadto Reuben Gad and the halftribe of Manasseh.
With him they sent ten of the chief men one for each of the tribes of Israel each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.
When they went to Gileadto Reuben Gad and the halftribe of Manassehthey said to them
After a long time had passed and the Lord had given Israel rest from all their enemies around them Joshua by then old and well advanced in years
summoned all Israeltheir elders leaders judges and officialsand said to them I am old and well advanced in years.
You yourselves have seen everything the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake it was the Lord your God who fought for you.
Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remainthe nations I conqueredbetween the Jordan and the Great Sea in the west.
The Lord your God himself will drive them out of your way. He will push them out before you and you will take possession of their land as the Lord your God promised you.
Be very strong be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses without turning aside to the right or to the left.
Do not associate with these nations that remain among you do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. You must not serve them or bow down to them.
But you are to hold fast to the Lord your God as you have until now.
The Lord has driven out before you great and powerful nations to this day no one has been able to withstand you.
One of you routs a thousand because the Lord your God fights for you just as he promised.
So be very careful to love the Lord your God.
But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them
then you may be sure that the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead they will become snares and traps for you whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes until you perish from this good land which the Lord your God has given you.
Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled not one has failed.
But just as every good promise of the Lord your God has come true so the Lord will bring on you all the evil he has threatened until he has destroyed you from this good land he has given you.
If you violate the covenant of the Lord your God which he commanded you and go and serve other gods and bow down to them the Lords anger will burn against you and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you.
Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders leaders judges and officials of Israel and they presented themselves before God.
Joshua said to all the people This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Long ago your forefathers including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor lived beyond the River and worshiped other gods.
But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the River and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac
and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
 Then I sent Moses and Aaron and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there and I brought you out.
When I brought your fathers out of Egypt you came to the sea and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea.
But they cried to the Lord for help and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians he brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the desert for a long time.
 I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you and you took possession of their land.
When Balak son of Zippor the king of Moab prepared to fight against Israel he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you.
But I would not listen to Balaam so he blessed you again and again and I delivered you out of his hand.
 Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you as did also the Amorites Perizzites Canaanites Hittites Girgashites Hivites and Jebusites but I gave them into your hands.
I sent the hornet ahead of you which drove them out before youalso the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow.
So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.
Now fear the Lord and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your forefathers worshiped beyond the River and in Egypt and serve the Lord.
But if serving the Lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household we will serve the Lord.
Then the people answered Far be it from us to forsake the Lord to serve other gods!
It was the Lord our God himself who brought us and our fathers up out of Egypt from that land of slavery and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled.
And the Lord drove out before us all the nations including the Amorites who lived in the land. We too will serve the Lord because he is our God.
Joshua said to the people You are not able to serve the Lord. He is a holy God he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.
If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you after he has been good to you.
But the people said to Joshua No! We will serve the Lord.
Then Joshua said You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the Lord. Yes we are witnesses they replied.
Now then said Joshua throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.
And the people said to Joshua We will serve the Lord our God and obey him.
On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people and there at Shechem he drew up for them decrees and laws.
And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the Lord.
See! he said to all the people. This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the Lord has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.
Then Joshua sent the people away each to his own inheritance.
After these things Joshua son of Nun the servant of the Lord died at the age of a hundred and ten.
And they buried him in the land of his inheritance at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.
Israel served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the Lord had done for Israel.
And Josephs bones which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Josephs descendants.
And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
After the death of Joshua the Israelites asked the Lord Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?
The Lord answered Judah is to go I have given the land into their hands.
Then the men of Judah said to the Simeonites their brothers Come up with us into the territory allotted to us to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours. So the Simeonites went with them.
When Judah attacked the Lord gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.
It was there that they found AdoniBezek and fought against him putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.
AdoniBezek fled but they chased him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
Then AdoniBezek said Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them. They brought him to Jerusalem and he died there.
The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
After that the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country the Negev and the western foothills.
They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron  and defeated Sheshai Ahiman and Talmai.
From there they advanced against the people living in Debir .
And Caleb said I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.
Othniel son of Kenaz Calebs younger brother took it so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
One day when she came to Othniel she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey Caleb asked her What can I do for you?
She replied Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev give me also springs of water. Then Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
The descendants of Moses fatherinlaw the Kenite went up from the City of Palms with the men of Judah to live among the people of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.
Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their brothers and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath and they totally destroyed the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.
The men of Judah also took Gaza Ashkelon and Ekroneach city with its territory.
The Lord was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country but they were unable to drive the people from the plains because they had iron chariots.
As Moses had promised Hebron was given to Caleb who drove from it the three sons of Anak.
The Benjamites however failed to dislodge the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.
Now the house of Joseph attacked Bethel and the Lord was with them.
The angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers. I said I will never break my covenant with you
and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land but you shall break down their altars. Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?
Now therefore I tell you that I will not drive them out before you they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.
When the angel of the Lord had spoken these things to all the Israelites the people wept aloud
and they called that place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to the Lord.
After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites they went to take possession of the land each to his own inheritance.
The people served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel.
Joshua son of Nun the servant of the Lord died at the age of a hundred and ten.
And they buried him in the land of his inheritance at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash.
After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers another generation grew up who knew neither the Lord nor what he had done for Israel.
Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and served the Baals.
They forsook the Lord the God of their fathers who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the Lord to anger
because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
In his anger against Israel the Lord handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around whom they were no longer able to resist.
Whenever Israel went out to fight the hand of the Lord was against them to defeat them just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.
Then the Lord raised up judges who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.
Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. Unlike their fathers they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked the way of obedience to the Lords commands.
Whenever the Lord raised up a judge for them he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived for the Lord had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.
But when the judge died the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and said Because this nation has violated the covenant that I laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me
I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it as their forefathers did.
The Lord had allowed those nations to remain he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.
These are the nations the Lord left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan

the five rulers of the Philistines all the Canaanites the Sidonians and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the Lords commands which he had given their forefathers through Moses.
The Israelites lived among the Canaanites Hittites Amorites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites.
They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.
The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord they forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
The anger of the Lord burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of CushanRishathaim king of Aram Naharaim to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.
But when they cried out to the Lord he raised up for them a deliverer Othniel son of Kenaz Calebs younger brother who saved them.
The Spirit of the Lord came upon him so that he became Israels judge and went to war. The Lord gave CushanRishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel who overpowered him.
So the land had peace for forty years until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
Once again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and because they did this evil the Lord gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.
Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him Eglon came and attacked Israel and they took possession of the City of Palms.
The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.
Again the Israelites cried out to the Lord and he gave them a delivererEhud a lefthanded man the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
Now Ehud had made a doubleedged sword about a foot and a half long which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.
He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab who was a very fat man.
After Ehud had presented the tribute he sent on their way the men who had carried it.
At the idols near Gilgal he himself turned back and said I have a secret message for you O king. The king said Quiet! And all his attendants left him.
Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his summer palace and said I have a message from God for you. As the king rose from his seat
Ehud reached with his left hand drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the kings belly.
Even the handle sank in after the blade which came out his back. Ehud did not pull the sword out and the fat closed in over it.
Then Ehud went out to the porch he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
After Ehud died the Israelites once again did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
So the Lord sold them into the hands of Jabin a king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.
Because he had nine hundred iron chariots and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years they cried to the Lord for help.
Deborah a prophetess the wife of Lappidoth was leading Israel at that time.
She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim and the Israelites came to her to have their disputes decided.
She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him The Lord the God of Israel commands you Go take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead the way to Mount Tabor.
I will lure Sisera the commander of Jabins army with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands. 
Barak said to her If you go with me I will go but if you dont go with me I wont go.
Very well Deborah said I will go with you. But because of the way you are going about this the honor will not be yours for the Lord will hand Sisera over to a woman. So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh
where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed him and Deborah also went with him.
Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites the descendants of Hobab Moses brotherinlaw and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.
When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor
Sisera gathered together his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River.
Then Deborah said to Barak Go! This is the day the Lord has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the Lord gone ahead of you? So Barak went down Mount Tabor followed by ten thousand men.
At Baraks advance the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot.
But Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim. All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword not a man was left.
Sisera however fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite because there were friendly relations between Jabin king of Hazor and the clan of Heber the Kenite.
Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him Come my lord come right in. Dont be afraid. So he entered her tent and she put a covering over him.
Im thirsty he said. Please give me some water. She opened a skin of milk gave him a drink and covered him up.
Stand in the doorway of the tent he told her. If someone comes by and asks you Is anyone here? say No. 
But Jael Hebers wife picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground and he died.
Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera and Jael went out to meet him. Come she said I will show you the man youre looking for. So he went in with her and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his templedead.
On that day God subdued Jabin the Canaanite king before the Israelites.
And the hand of the Israelites grew stronger and stronger against Jabin the Canaanite king until they destroyed him.
On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song
When the princes in Israel take the lead when the people willingly offer themselves praise the Lord!
Hear this you kings! Listen you rulers! I will sing to the Lord I will sing I will make music to the Lord the God of Israel.
O Lord when you went out from Seir when you marched from the land of Edom the earth shook the heavens poured the clouds poured down water.
The mountains quaked before the Lord the One of Sinai before the Lord the God of Israel.
In the days of Shamgar son of Anath in the days of Jael the roads were abandoned travelers took to winding paths.
Village life in Israel ceased ceased until I Deborah arose arose a mother in Israel.
When they chose new gods war came to the city gates and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.
My heart is with Israels princes with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the Lord!
You who ride on white donkeys sitting on your saddle blankets and you who walk along the road consider
the voice of the singers at the watering places. They recite the righteous acts of the Lord the righteous acts of his warriors in Israel. Then the people of the Lord went down to the city gates.
Wake up wake up Deborah! Wake up wake up break out in song! Arise O Barak! Take captive your captives O son of Abinoam.
Then the men who were left came down to the nobles the people of the Lord came to me with the mighty.
Some came from Ephraim whose roots were in Amalek Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down from Zebulun those who bear a commanders staff.
The princes of Issachar were with Deborah yes Issachar was with Barak rushing after him into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.
Why did you stay among the campfires to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.
Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves.
The people of Zebulun risked their very lives so did Naphtali on the heights of the field.
Kings came they fought the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo but they carried off no silver no plunder.
From the heavens the stars fought from their courses they fought against Sisera.
The river Kishon swept them away the ageold river the river Kishon. March on my soul be strong!
Then thundered the horses hoofs galloping galloping go his mighty steeds.
Curse Meroz said the angel of the Lord. Curse its people bitterly because they did not come to help the Lord to help the Lord against the mighty.
Most blessed of women be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite most blessed of tentdwelling women.
He asked for water and she gave him milk in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.
Her hand reached for the tent peg her right hand for the workmans hammer. She struck Sisera she crushed his head she shattered and pierced his temple.
At her feet he sank he fell there he lay. At her feet he sank he fell where he sank there he felldead.
Through the window peered Siseras mother behind the lattice she cried out Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?
The wisest of her ladies answer her indeed she keeps saying to herself
Are they not finding and dividing the spoils a girl or two for each man colorful garments as plunder for Sisera colorful garments embroidered highly embroidered garments for my neck all this as plunder?
So may all your enemies perish O Lord! But may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength. Then the land had peace forty years.
Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites.
Because the power of Midian was so oppressive the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts caves and strongholds.
Whenever the Israelites planted their crops the Midianites Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country.
They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.
They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels they invaded the land to ravage it.
Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the Lord for help.
When the Israelites cried to the Lord because of Midian
he sent them a prophet who said This is what the Lord the God of Israel says I brought you up out of Egypt out of the land of slavery.
I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land.
I said to you I am the Lord your God do not worship the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live. But you have not listened to me.
The angel of the Lord came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.
When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon he said The Lord is with you mighty warrior.
But sir Gideon replied if the Lord is with us why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt? But now the Lord has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.
The Lord turned to him and said Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midians hand. Am I not sending you?
But Lord Gideon asked how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh and I am the least in my family.
The Lord answered I will be with you and you will strike down all the Midianites together.
Gideon replied If now I have found favor in your eyes give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.
Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you. And the Lord said I will wait until you return.
Gideon went in prepared a young goat and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.
The angel of God said to him Take the meat and the unleavened bread place them on this rock and pour out the broth. And Gideon did so.
With the tip of the staff that was in his hand the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the Lord disappeared.
When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord he exclaimed Ah Sovereign Lord! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!
But the Lord said to him Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.
So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Early in the morning JerubBaal  and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.
The Lord said to Gideon You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her
announce now to the people Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.  So twentytwo thousand men left while ten thousand remained.
But the Lord said to Gideon There are still too many men. Take them down to the water and I will sift them for you there. If I say This one shall go with you he shall go but if I say This one shall not go with you he shall not go.
So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the Lord told him Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink.
Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.
The Lord said to Gideon With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go each to his own place.
So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.
During that night the Lord said to Gideon Get up go down against the camp because I am going to give it into your hands.
If you are afraid to attack go down to the camp with your servant Purah
and listen to what they are saying. Afterward you will be encouraged to attack the camp. So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.
The Midianites the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.
Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. I had a dream he was saying. A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.
His friend responded This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.
When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into your hands.
Dividing the three hundred men into three companies he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them with torches inside.
Watch me he told them. Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp do exactly as I do.
When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets then from all around the camp blow yours and shout For the Lord and for Gideon. 
Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.
The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow they shouted A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!
While each man held his position around the camp all the Midianites ran crying out as they fled.
When the three hundred trumpets sounded the Lord caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.
Israelites from Naphtali Asher and all Manasseh were called out and they pursued the Midianites.
Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim saying Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah. So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.
They also captured two of the Midianite leaders Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon who was by the Jordan.
Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon Why have you treated us like this? Why didnt you call us when you went to fight Midian? And they criticized him sharply.
But he answered them What have I accomplished compared to you? Arent the gleanings of Ephraims grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?
God gave Oreb and Zeeb the Midianite leaders into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you? At this their resentment against him subsided.
Gideon and his three hundred men exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit came to the Jordan and crossed it.
He said to the men of Succoth Give my troops some bread they are worn out and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna the kings of Midian.
But the officials of Succoth said Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?
Then Gideon replied Just for that when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.
From there he went up to Peniel and made the same request of them but they answered as the men of Succoth had.
So he said to the men of Peniel When I return in triumph I will tear down this tower.
Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.
Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and fell upon the unsuspecting army.
Zebah and Zalmunna the two kings of Midian fled but he pursued them and captured them routing their entire army.
Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.
He caught a young man of Succoth and questioned him and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventyseven officials of Succoth the elders of the town.
Then Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth Here are Zebah and Zalmunna about whom you taunted me by saying Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men? 
He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.
He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.
Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna What kind of men did you kill at Tabor? Men like you they answered each one with the bearing of a prince.
Gideon replied Those were my brothers the sons of my own mother. As surely as the Lord lives if you had spared their lives I would not kill you.
Turning to Jether his oldest son he said Kill them! But Jether did not draw his sword because he was only a boy and was afraid.
Zebah and Zalmunna said Come do it yourself. As is the man so is his strength.  So Gideon stepped forward and killed them and took the ornaments off their camels necks.
The Israelites said to Gideon Rule over usyou your son and your grandsonbecause you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.
But Gideon told them I will not rule over you nor will my son rule over you. The Lord will rule over you.
And he said I do have one request that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.
They answered Well be glad to give them. So they spread out a garment and each man threw a ring from his plunder onto it.
The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels not counting the ornaments the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels necks.
Gideon made the gold into an ephod which he placed in Ophrah his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.
Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideons lifetime the land enjoyed peace forty years.
JerubBaal son of Joash went back home to live.
He had seventy sons of his own for he had many wives.
His concubine who lived in Shechem also bore him a son whom he named Abimelech.
Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up BaalBerith as their god and
did not remember the Lord their God who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
They also failed to show kindness to the family of JerubBaal  for all the good things he had done for them.
Abimelech son of JerubBaal went to his mothers brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mothers clan
Ask all the citizens of Shechem Which is better for you to have all seventy of JerubBaals sons rule over you or just one man? Remember I am your flesh and blood.
When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem they were inclined to follow Abimelech for they said He is our brother.
They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of BaalBerith and Abimelech used it to hire reckless adventurers who became his followers.
He went to his fathers home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers the sons of JerubBaal. But Jotham the youngest son of JerubBaal escaped by hiding.
Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelech king.
When Jotham was told about this he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them Listen to me citizens of Shechem so that God may listen to you.
One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree Be our king.
But the olive tree answered Should I give up my oil by which both gods and men are honored to hold sway over the trees?
Next the trees said to the fig tree Come and be our king.
But the fig tree replied Should I give up my fruit so good and sweet to hold sway over the trees?
Then the trees said to the vine Come and be our king.
But the vine answered Should I give up my wine which cheers both gods and men to hold sway over the trees?
Finally all the trees said to the thornbush Come and be our king.
The thornbush said to the trees If you really want to anoint me king over you come and take refuge in my shade but if not then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!
Now if you have acted honorably and in good faith when you made Abimelech king and if you have been fair to JerubBaal and his family and if you have treated him as he deserves
and to think that my father fought for you risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian
After the time of Abimelech a man of Issachar Tola son of Puah the son of Dodo rose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
He led Israel twentythree years then he died and was buried in Shamir.
He was followed by Jair of Gilead who led Israel twentytwo years.
He had thirty sons who rode thirty donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in Gilead which to this day are called Havvoth Jair.
When Jair died he was buried in Kamon.
Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord. They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths and the gods of Aram the gods of Sidon the gods of Moab the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. And because the Israelites forsook the Lord and no longer served him
he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites
who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead the land of the Amorites.
The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah Benjamin and the house of Ephraim and Israel was in great distress.
Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord We have sinned against you forsaking our God and serving the Baals.
The Lord replied When the Egyptians the Amorites the Ammonites the Philistines
the Sidonians the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you and you cried to me for help did I not save you from their hands?
But you have forsaken me and served other gods so I will no longer save you.
Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you are in trouble!
But the Israelites said to the Lord We have sinned. Do with us whatever you think best but please rescue us now.
Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the Lord. And he could bear Israels misery no longer.
When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other Whoever will launch the attack against the Ammonites will be the head of all those living in Gilead.
Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead his mother was a prostitute.
Gileads wife also bore him sons and when they were grown up they drove Jephthah away. You are not going to get any inheritance in our family they said because you are the son of another woman.
So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob where a group of adventurers gathered around him and followed him.
Some time later when the Ammonites made war on Israel
the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
Come they said be our commander so we can fight the Ammonites.
Jephthah said to them Didnt you hate me and drive me from my fathers house? Why do you come to me now when youre in trouble?
The elders of Gilead said to him Nevertheless we are turning to you now come with us to fight the Ammonites and you will be our head over all who live in Gilead.
Jephthah answered Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the Lord gives them to mewill I really be your head?
The elders of Gilead replied The Lord is our witness we will certainly do as you say.
So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the Lord in Mizpah.
Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question What do you have against us that you have attacked our country?
The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthahs messengers When Israel came up out of Egypt they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably.
Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king
The men of Ephraim called out their forces crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? Were going to burn down your house over your head.
Jephthah answered I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites and although I called you didnt save me out of their hands.
When I saw that you wouldnt help I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites and the Lord gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?
Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh.
The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said Let me cross over the men of Gilead asked him Are you an Ephraimite? If he replied No
they said All right say Shibboleth.  If he said Sibboleth because he could not pronounce the word correctly they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Fortytwo thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.
Jephthah led Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in a town in Gilead.
After him Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.
He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led Israel seven years.
Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.
After him Elon the Zebulunite led Israel ten years.
Then Elon died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
After him Abdon son of Hillel from Pirathon led Israel.
He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel eight years.
Then Abdon son of Hillel died and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites.
Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord so the Lord delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.
A certain man of Zorah named Manoah from the clan of the Danites had a wife who was sterile and remained childless.
The angel of the Lord appeared to her and said You are sterile and childless but you are going to conceive and have a son.
Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean
because you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor may be used on his head because the boy is to be a Nazirite set apart to God from birth and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines.
Then the woman went to her husband and told him A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God very awesome. I didnt ask him where he came from and he didnt tell me his name.
But he said to me You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now then drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death. 
Then Manoah prayed to the Lord O Lord I beg you let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.
God heard Manoah and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field but her husband Manoah was not with her.
The woman hurried to tell her husband Hes here! The man who appeared to me the other day!
Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man he said Are you the one who talked to my wife? I am he said.
So Manoah asked him When your words are fulfilled what is to be the rule for the boys life and work?
The angel of the Lord answered Your wife must do all that I have told her.
She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.
Manoah said to the angel of the Lord We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.
The angel of the Lord replied Even though you detain me I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering offer it to the Lord.
Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the Lord What is your name so that we may honor you when your word comes true?
He replied Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding.
Then Manoah took a young goat together with the grain offering and sacrificed it on a rock to the Lord. And the Lord did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched
Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a young Philistine woman.
When he returned he said to his father and mother I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah now get her for me as my wife.
His father and mother replied Isnt there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife? But Samson said to his father Get her for me. Shes the right one for me.

Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.
The Spirit of the Lord came upon him in power so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done.
Then he went down and talked with the woman and he liked her.
Some time later when he went back to marry her he turned aside to look at the lions carcass. In it was a swarm of bees and some honey
which he scooped out with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents he gave them some and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lions carcass.
Now his father went down to see the woman. And Samson made a feast there as was customary for bridegrooms.
When he appeared he was given thirty companions.
Let me tell you a riddle Samson said to them. If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
If you cant tell me the answer you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. Tell us your riddle they said. Lets hear it.
He replied Out of the eater something to eat out of the strong something sweet. For three days they could not give the answer.
On the fourth day they said to Samsons wife Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us or we will burn you and your fathers household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?
Then Samsons wife threw herself on him sobbing You hate me! You dont really love me. Youve given my people a riddle but you havent told me the answer. I havent even explained it to my father or mother he replied so why should I explain it to you?
She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.
Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion? Samson said to them If you had not plowed with my heifer you would not have solved my riddle.
Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him in power. He went down to Ashkelon struck down thirty of their men stripped them of their belongings and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger he went up to his fathers house.
And Samsons wife was given to the friend who had attended him at his wedding.
Later on at the time of wheat harvest Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said Im going to my wifes room. But her father would not let him go in.
I was so sure you thoroughly hated her he said that I gave her to your friend. Isnt her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead.
Samson said to them This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines I will really harm them.
So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails
lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain together with the vineyards and olive groves.
When the Philistines asked Who did this? they were told Samson the Timnites soninlaw because his wife was given to his friend. So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.
Samson said to them Since youve acted like this I wont stop until I get my revenge on you.
He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.
The Philistines went up and camped in Judah spreading out near Lehi.
The men of Judah asked Why have you come to fight us? We have come to take Samson prisoner they answered to do to him as he did to us.
Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson Dont you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us? He answered I merely did to them what they did to me.
They said to him Weve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines. Samson said Swear to me that you wont kill me yourselves.
Agreed they answered. We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you. So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.
As he approached Lehi the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the Lord came upon him in power. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax and the bindings dropped from his hands.
Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.
Then Samson said With a donkeys jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkeys jawbone I have killed a thousand men.
When he finished speaking he threw away the jawbone and the place was called Ramath Lehi.
Because he was very thirsty he cried out to the Lord You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?
Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi and water came out of it. When Samson drank his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore and it is still there in Lehi.
Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
One day Samson went to Gaza where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.
The people of Gaza were told Samson is here! So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night saying At dawn well kill him.
But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate together with the two posts and tore them loose bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.
Some time later he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.
The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.
So Delilah said to Samson Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.
Samson answered her If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried Ill become as weak as any other man.
Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried and she tied him with them.
With men hidden in the room she called to him Samson the Philistines are upon you! But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.
Then Delilah said to Samson You have made a fool of me you lied to me. Come now tell me how you can be tied.
He said If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used Ill become as weak as any other man.
So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then with men hidden in the room she called to him Samson the Philistines are upon you! But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.
Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim
said to his mother The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curseI have that silver with me I took it. Then his mother said The Lord bless you my son!
When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother she said I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you.
So he returned the silver to his mother and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith who made them into the image and the idol. And they were put in Micahs house.
Now this man Micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.
In those days Israel had no king everyone did as he saw fit.
A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah who had been living within the clan of Judah
left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micahs house in the hill country of Ephraim.
Micah asked him Where are you from? Im a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah he said and Im looking for a place to stay.
Then Micah said to him Live with me and be my father and priest and Ill give you ten shekels of silver a year your clothes and your food.
So the Levite agreed to live with him and the young man was to him like one of his sons.
Then Micah installed the Levite and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.
And Micah said Now I know that the Lord will be good to me since this Levite has become my priest.
In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them Go explore the land. The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah where they spent the night.
When they were near Micahs house they recognized the voice of the young Levite so they turned in there and asked him Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?
He told them what Micah had done for him and said He has hired me and I am his priest.
Then they said to him Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.
The priest answered them Go in peace. Your journey has the Lords approval.
So the five men left and came to Laish where they saw that the people were living in safety like the Sidonians unsuspecting and secure. And since their land lacked nothing they were prosperous. Also they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else.
When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol their brothers asked them How did you find things?
They answered Come on lets attack them! We have seen that the land is very good. Arent you going to do something? Dont hesitate to go there and take it over.
When you get there you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands a land that lacks nothing whatever.
Then six hundred men from the clan of the Danites armed for battle set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.
From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micahs house.
Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their brothers Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod other household gods a carved image and a cast idol? Now you know what to do.
So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micahs place and greeted him.
The six hundred Danites armed for battle stood at the entrance to the gate.
The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image the ephod the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate.
When these men went into Micahs house and took the carved image the ephod the other household gods and the cast idol the priest said to them What are you doing?
They answered him Be quiet! Dont say a word. Come with us and be our father and priest. Isnt it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one mans household?
Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.
Putting their little children their livestock and their possessions in front of them they turned away and left.
When they had gone some distance from Micahs house the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.
As they shouted after them the Danites turned and said to Micah Whats the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?
He replied You took the gods I made and my priest and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask Whats the matter with you? 
The Danites answered Dont argue with us or some hottempered men will attack you and you and your family will lose your lives.
So the Danites went their way and Micah seeing that they were too strong for him turned around and went back home.
Then they took what Micah had made and his priest and went on to Laish against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.
There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.
They named it Dan after their forefather Dan who was born to Israelthough the city used to be called Laish.
In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her fathers house in Bethlehem Judah. After she had been there four months
her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her fathers house and when her father saw him he gladly welcomed him.
His fatherinlaw the girls father prevailed upon him to stay so he remained with him three days eating and drinking and sleeping there.
On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave but the girls father said to his soninlaw Refresh yourself with something to eat then you can go.
So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girls father said Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself.
And when the man got up to go his fatherinlaw persuaded him so he stayed there that night.
On the morning of the fifth day when he rose to go the girls father said Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon! So the two of them ate together.
Then when the man with his concubine and his servant got up to leave his fatherinlaw the girls father said Now look its almost evening. Spend the night here the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.
But unwilling to stay another night the man left and went toward Jebus  with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone the servant said to his master Come lets stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.
His master replied No. We wont go into an alien city whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.
He added Come lets try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.
So they went on and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square but no one took them into his home for the night.
That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim who was living in Gibeah  came in from his work in the fields.
When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square the old man asked Where are you going? Where did you come from?
He answered We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the Lord. No one has taken me into his house.
We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servantsme your maidservant and the young man with us. We dont need anything.
You are welcome at my house the old man said. Let me supply whatever you need. Only dont spend the night in the square.
So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet they had something to eat and drink.
Look here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man dont do such a disgraceful thing.
But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them and they raped her and abused her throughout the night and at dawn they let her go.
At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.
When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way there lay his concubine fallen in the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold.
He said to her Get up lets go. But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.
When he reached home he took a knife and cut up his concubine limb by limb into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.
Everyone who saw it said Such a thing has never been seen or done not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!
Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out as one man and assembled before the Lord in Mizpah.
The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of the people of God four hundred thousand soldiers armed with swords.
Then the Israelites said Tell us how this awful thing happened.
So the Levite the husband of the murdered woman said I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.
During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house intending to kill me. They raped my concubine and she died.
I took my concubine cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israels inheritance because they committed this lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
Now all you Israelites speak up and give your verdict.
All the people rose as one man saying None of us will go home. No not one of us will return to his house.
But now this is what well do to Gibeah Well go up against it as the lot directs.
Well take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel and a hundred from a thousand and a thousand from ten thousand to get provisions for the army. Then when the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin it can give them what they deserve for all this vileness done in Israel.
So all the men of Israel got together and united as one man against the city.
The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin saying What about this awful crime that was committed among you?
Now surrender those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel. But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.
From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.
At once the Benjamites mobilized twentysix thousand swordsmen from their towns in addition to seven hundred chosen men from those living in Gibeah.
Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were lefthanded each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
Israel apart from Benjamin mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen all of them fighting men.
The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They said Who of us shall go first to fight against the Benjamites? The Lord replied Judah shall go first.
The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah.
The men of Israel went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.
The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twentytwo thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.
But the men of Israel encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day.
The Israelites went up and wept before the Lord until evening and they inquired of the Lord. They said Shall we go up again to battle against the Benjamites our brothers? The Lord answered Go up against them.
Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day.
The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.
The people went to Bethel where they sat before God until evening raising their voices and weeping bitterly.
O Lord the God of Israel they cried why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?
Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
Then the Israelites asked Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the Lord? For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah should certainly be put to death.
Now the Israelites grieved for their brothers the Benjamites. Today one tribe is cut off from Israel they said.
How can we provide wives for those who are left since we have taken an oath by the Lord not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?
Then they asked Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah? They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.
For when they counted the people they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.
So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there including the women and children.
This is what you are to do they said. Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.
They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.
So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.
The people grieved for Benjamin because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.
And the elders of the assembly said With the women of Benjamin destroyed how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?
The Benjamite survivors must have heirs they said so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.
We cant give them our daughters as wives since we Israelites have taken this oath Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.
But look there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh to the north of Bethel and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem and to the south of Lebonah.
So they instructed the Benjamites saying Go and hide in the vineyards
and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.
In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land and a man from Bethlehem in Judah together with his wife and two sons went to live for a while in the country of Moab.
The mans name was Elimelech his wifes name Naomi and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.
Now Elimelech Naomis husband died and she was left with her two sons.
They married Moabite women one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years
both Mahlon and Kilion also died and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
When she heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them Naomi and her daughtersinlaw prepared to return home from there.
With her two daughtersinlaw she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
Then Naomi said to her two daughtersinlaw Go back each of you to your mothers home. May the Lord show kindness to you as you have shown to your dead and to me.
May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband. Then she kissed them and they wept aloud
and said to her We will go back with you to your people.
But Naomi said Return home my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons who could become your husbands?
Return home my daughters I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for meeven if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons
would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you because the Lords hand has gone out against me!
At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her motherinlaw goodby but Ruth clung to her.
Look said Naomi your sisterinlaw is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.
But Ruth replied Dont urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.
Where you die I will die and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me be it ever so severely if anything but death separates you and me.
When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her she stopped urging her.
So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem the whole town was stirred because of them and the women exclaimed Can this be Naomi?
Dont call me Naomi she told them. Call me Mara because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
I went away full but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.
So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess her daughterinlaw arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
Now Naomi had a relative on her husbands side from the clan of Elimelech a man of standing whose name was Boaz.
And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor. Naomi said to her Go ahead my daughter.
So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz who was from the clan of Elimelech.
Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters The Lord be with you! The Lord bless you! they called back.
Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters Whose young woman is that?
The foreman replied She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi.
She said Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters. She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now except for a short rest in the shelter.
So Boaz said to Ruth My daughter listen to me. Dont go and glean in another field and dont go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.
Watch the field where the men are harvesting and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.
At this she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice mea foreigner?
Boaz replied Ive been told all about what you have done for your motherinlaw since the death of your husbandhow you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.
May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord the God of Israel under whose wings you have come to take refuge.
May I continue to find favor in your eyes my lord she said. You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servantthough I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls.
At mealtime Boaz said to her Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar. When she sat down with the harvesters he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
As she got up to glean Boaz gave orders to his men Even if she gathers among the sheaves dont embarrass her.
Rather pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up and dont rebuke her.
So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered and it amounted to about an ephah.
One day Naomi her motherinlaw said to her My daughter should I not try to find a home for you where you will be well provided for?
Is not Boaz with whose servant girls you have been a kinsman of ours? Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
Wash and perfume yourself and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor but dont let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
When he lies down note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.
I will do whatever you say Ruth answered.
So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her motherinlaw told her to do.
When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly uncovered his feet and lay down.
In the middle of the night something startled the man and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.
Who are you? he asked. I am your servant Ruth she said. Spread the corner of your garment over me since you are a kinsmanredeemer.
The Lord bless you my daughter he replied. This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier You have not run after the younger men whether rich or poor.
And now my daughter dont be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character.
Although it is true that I am near of kin there is a kinsmanredeemer nearer than I.
Stay here for the night and in the morning if he wants to redeem good let him redeem. But if he is not willing as surely as the Lord lives I will do it. Lie here until morning.
So she lay at his feet until morning but got up before anyone could be recognized and he said Dont let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.
He also said Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out. When she did so he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her. Then he went back to town.
When Ruth came to her motherinlaw Naomi asked How did it go my daughter? Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her
and added He gave me these six measures of barley saying Dont go back to your motherinlaw emptyhanded. 
Then Naomi said Wait my daughter until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.
Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there. When the kinsmanredeemer he had mentioned came along Boaz said Come over here my friend and sit down. So he went over and sat down.
Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said Sit here and they did so.
Then he said to the kinsmanredeemer Naomi who has come back from Moab is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it do so. But if you will not tell me so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you and I am next in line. I will redeem it he said.
Then Boaz said On the day you buy the land from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess you acquire the dead mans widow in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property.
At this the kinsmanredeemer said Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.

So the kinsmanredeemer said to Boaz Buy it yourself. And he removed his sandal.
Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech Kilion and Mahlon.
I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess Mahlons widow as my wife in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records. Today you are witnesses!
Then the elders and all those at the gate said We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah who together built up the house of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
Through the offspring the Lord gives you by this young woman may your family be like that of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah.
So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. Then he went to her and the Lord enabled her to conceive and she gave birth to a son.
The women said to Naomi Praise be to the Lord who this day has not left you without a kinsmanredeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!
He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughterinlaw who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons has given him birth.
Then Naomi took the child laid him in her lap and cared for him.
The women living there said Naomi has a son. And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse the father of David.
This then is the family line of Perez Perez was the father of Hezron
Hezron the father of Ram Ram the father of Amminadab
Amminadab the father of Nahshon Nahshon the father of Salmon
Salmon the father of Boaz Boaz the father of Obed
Obed the father of Jesse and Jesse the father of David.
There was a certain man from Ramathaim a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham the son of Elihu the son of Tohu the son of Zuph an Ephraimite.
He had two wives one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children but Hannah had none.
Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh where Hophni and Phinehas the two sons of Eli were priests of the Lord.
Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her and the Lord had closed her womb.
And because the Lord had closed her womb her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.
This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.
Elkanah her husband would say to her Hannah why are you weeping? Why dont you eat? Why are you downhearted? Dont I mean more to you than ten sons?
Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the Lords temple.
In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the Lord.
And she made a vow saying O Lord Almighty if you will only look upon your servants misery and remember me and not forget your servant but give her a son then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life and no razor will ever be used on his head.
As she kept on praying to the Lord Eli observed her mouth.
Hannah was praying in her heart and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk
and said to her How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.
Not so my lord Hannah replied I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer I was pouring out my soul to the Lord.
Do not take your servant for a wicked woman I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.
Eli answered Go in peace and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.
She said May your servant find favor in your eyes. Then she went her way and ate something and her face was no longer downcast.
Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the Lord and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her.
So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel saying Because I asked the Lord for him.
When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfill his vow
Hannah did not go. She said to her husband After the boy is weaned I will take him and present him before the Lord and he will live there always.
Do what seems best to you Elkanah her husband told her. Stay here until you have weaned him only may the Lord make good his word. So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
After he was weaned she took the boy with her young as he was along with a threeyearold bull an ephah of flour and a skin of wine and brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh.
When they had slaughtered the bull they brought the boy to Eli
and she said to him As surely as you live my lord I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord.
I prayed for this child and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him.
So now I give him to the Lord. For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord. And he worshiped the Lord there.
Then Hannah prayed and said My heart rejoices in the Lord in the Lord my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies for I delight in your deliverance.
There is no one holy like the Lord there is no one besides you there is no Rock like our God.
Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance for the Lord is a God who knows and by him deeds are weighed.
The bows of the warriors are broken but those who stumbled are armed with strength.
Those who were full hire themselves out for food but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children but she who has had many sons pines away.
The Lord brings death and makes alive he brings down to the grave and raises up.
The Lord sends poverty and wealth he humbles and he exalts.
He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. For the foundations of the earth are the Lords upon them he has set the world.
He will guard the feet of his saints but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. It is not by strength that one prevails
those who oppose the Lord will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven the Lord will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.
Then Elkanah went home to Ramah but the boy ministered before the Lord under Eli the priest.
Elis sons were wicked men they had no regard for the Lord.
Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled the servant of the priest would come with a threepronged fork in his hand.
He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
But even before the fat was burned the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing Give the priest some meat to roast he wont accept boiled meat from you but only raw.
If the man said to him Let the fat be burned up first and then take whatever you want the servant would then answer No hand it over now if you dont Ill take it by force.
This sin of the young men was very great in the Lords sight for they were treating the Lords offering with contempt.
But Samuel was ministering before the Lorda boy wearing a linen ephod.
Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife saying May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the Lord. Then they would go home.
The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli. In those days the word of the Lord was rare there were not many visions.
One night Eli whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see was lying down in his usual place.
The lamp of God had not yet gone out and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was.
Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered Here I am.
And he ran to Eli and said Here I am you called me. But Eli said I did not call go back and lie down. So he went and lay down.
Again the Lord called Samuel! And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said Here I am you called me. My son Eli said I did not call go back and lie down.
Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.
The Lord called Samuel a third time and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said Here I am you called me. Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy.
So Eli told Samuel Go and lie down and if he calls you say Speak Lord for your servant is listening.  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
The Lord came and stood there calling as at the other times Samuel! Samuel! Then Samuel said Speak for your servant is listening.
And the Lord said to Samuel See I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.
At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his familyfrom beginning to end.
For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about his sons made themselves contemptible and he failed to restrain them.
Therefore I swore to the house of Eli The guilt of Elis house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering. 
Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision
but Eli called him and said Samuel my son. Samuel answered Here I am.
What was it he said to you? Eli asked. Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you be it ever so severely if you hide from me anything he told you.
So Samuel told him everything hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said He is the Lord let him do what is good in his eyes.
The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up and he let none of his words fall to the ground.
And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the Lord.
The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.
And Samuels word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer and the Philistines at Aphek.
The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel and as the battle spread Israel was defeated by the Philistines who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.
When the soldiers returned to camp the elders of Israel asked Why did the Lord bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lords covenant from Shiloh so that it may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.
So the people sent men to Shiloh and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord Almighty who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Elis two sons Hophni and Phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
When the ark of the Lords covenant came into the camp all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.
Hearing the uproar the Philistines asked Whats all this shouting in the Hebrew camp? When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp
the Philistines were afraid. A god has come into the camp they said. Were in trouble! Nothing like this has happened before.
Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert.
Be strong Philistines! Be men or you will be subject to the Hebrews as they have been to you. Be men and fight!
So the Philistines fought and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.
The ark of God was captured and Elis two sons Hophni and Phinehas died.
After the Philistines had captured the ark of God they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
Then they carried the ark into Dagons temple and set it beside Dagon.
When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day there was Dagon fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.
But the following morning when they rose there was Dagon fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold only his body remained.
That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagons temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.
The Lords hand was heavy upon the people of Ashdod and its vicinity he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors.
When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening they said The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us because his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.
So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel? They answered Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath. So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.
But after they had moved it the Lords hand was against that city throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city both young and old with an outbreak of tumors.
So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron the people of Ekron cried out They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people.
So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said Send the ark of the god of Israel away let it go back to its own place or it will kill us and our people. For death had filled the city with panic Gods hand was very heavy upon it.
Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
When the ark of the Lord had been in Philistine territory seven months
the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.
They answered If you return the ark of the god of Israel do not send it away empty but by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.
The Philistines asked What guilt offering should we send to him? They replied Five gold tumors and five gold rats according to the number of the Philistine rulers because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.
Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country and pay honor to Israels god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.
Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When he treated them harshly did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?
Now then get a new cart ready with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart but take their calves away and pen them up.
Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way
but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory toward Beth Shemesh then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us and that it happened to us by chance.
So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.
They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.
Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh keeping on the road and lowing all the way they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley and when they looked up and saw the ark they rejoiced at the sight.
The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.
The Levites took down the ark of the Lord together with the chest containing the gold objects and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord.
The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.
So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord. They took it to Abinadabs house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the Lord.
It was a long time twenty years in all that the ark remained at Kiriath Jearim and all the people of Israel mourned and sought after the Lord.
And Samuel said to the whole house of Israel If you are returning to the Lord with all your hearts then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths and served the Lord only.
Then Samuel said Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede with the Lord for you.
When they had assembled at Mizpah they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. On that day they fasted and there they confessed We have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel was leader of Israel at Mizpah.
When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. And when the Israelites heard of it they were afraid because of the Philistines.
They said to Samuel Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines.
Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on Israels behalf and the Lord answered him.
While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.
The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Car.
Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer saying Thus far has the Lord helped us.
So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again. Throughout Samuels lifetime the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.
The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to her and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
Samuel continued as judge over Israel all the days of his life.
From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah judging Israel in all those places.
But he always went back to Ramah where his home was and there he also judged Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord.
When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges for Israel.
The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah and they served at Beersheba.
But his sons did not walk in his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.
So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
They said to him You are old and your sons do not walk in your ways now appoint a king to lead us such as all the other nations have.
But when they said Give us a king to lead us this displeased Samuel so he prayed to the Lord.
And the Lord told him Listen to all that the people are saying to you it is not you they have rejected but they have rejected me as their king.
As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day forsaking me and serving other gods so they are doing to you.
Now listen to them but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do.
Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king.
He said This is what the king who will reign over you will do He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses and they will run in front of his chariots.
Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.
He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.
Your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use.
He will take a tenth of your flocks and you yourselves will become his slaves.
When that day comes you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen and the Lord will not answer you in that day.
But the people refused to listen to Samuel. No! they said. We want a king over us.
Then we will be like all the other nations with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.
When Samuel heard all that the people said he repeated it before the Lord.
The Lord answered Listen to them and give them a king. Then Samuel said to the men of Israel Everyone go back to his town.
There was a Benjamite a man of standing whose name was Kish son of Abiel the son of Zeror the son of Becorath the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.
He had a son named Saul an impressive young man without equal among the Israelitesa head taller than any of the others.
Now the donkeys belonging to Sauls father Kish were lost and Kish said to his son Saul Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.
So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin but they did not find them.
When they reached the district of Zuph Saul said to the servant who was with him Come lets go back or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.
But the servant replied Look in this town there is a man of God he is highly respected and everything he says comes true. Lets go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take.
Saul said to his servant If we go what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?
The servant answered him again. Look he said I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take.

Good Saul said to his servant. Come lets go. So they set out for the town where the man of God was.
As they were going up the hill to the town they met some girls coming out to draw water and they asked them Is the seer here?
He is they answered. Hes ahead of you. Hurry now he has just come to our town today for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.
As soon as you enter the town you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes because he must bless the sacrifice afterward those who are invited will eat. Go up now you should find him about this time.
They went up to the town and as they were entering it there was Samuel coming toward them on his way up to the high place.
Now the day before Saul came the Lord had revealed this to Samuel
About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him leader over my people Israel he will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked upon my people for their cry has reached me.
When Samuel caught sight of Saul the Lord said to him This is the man I spoke to you about he will govern my people.
Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked Would you please tell me where the seers house is?
I am the seer Samuel replied. Go up ahead of me to the high place for today you are to eat with me and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.
As for the donkeys you lost three days ago do not worry about them they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned if not to you and all your fathers family?
Saul answered But am I not a Benjamite from the smallest tribe of Israel and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?
Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invitedabout thirty in number.
Samuel said to the cook Bring the piece of meat I gave you the one I told you to lay aside.
So the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said Here is what has been kept for you. Eat because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said I have invited guests.  And Saul dined with Samuel that day.
After they came down from the high place to the town Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.
They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof Get ready and I will send you on your way. When Saul got ready he and Samuel went outside together.
As they were going down to the edge of the town Samuel said to Saul Tell the servant to go on ahead of usand the servant did sobut you stay here awhile so that I may give you a message from God.
Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Sauls head and kissed him saying Has not the Lord anointed you leader over his inheritance?
When you leave me today you will meet two men near Rachels tomb at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking What shall I do about my son? 
Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats another three loaves of bread and another a skin of wine.
They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread which you will accept from them.
After that you will go to Gibeah of God where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres tambourines flutes and harps being played before them and they will be prophesying.
The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you in power and you will prophesy with them and you will be changed into a different person.
Once these signs are fulfilled do whatever your hand finds to do for God is with you.
Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.
As Saul turned to leave Samuel God changed Sauls heart and all these signs were fulfilled that day.
When they arrived at Gibeah a procession of prophets met him the Spirit of God came upon him in power and he joined in their prophesying.
When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets they asked each other What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
A man who lived there answered And who is their father? So it became a saying Is Saul also among the prophets?
After Saul stopped prophesying he went to the high place.
Now Sauls uncle asked him and his servant Where have you been? Looking for the donkeys he said. But when we saw they were not to be found we went to Samuel.
Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him Make a treaty with us and we will be subject to you.
But Nahash the Ammonite replied I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel.
The elders of Jabesh said to him Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel if no one comes to rescue us we will surrender to you.
When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people they all wept aloud.
Just then Saul was returning from the fields behind his oxen and he asked What is wrong with the people? Why are they weeping? Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.
When Saul heard their words the Spirit of God came upon him in power and he burned with anger.
He took a pair of oxen cut them into pieces and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel proclaiming This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel. Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people and they turned out as one man.
When Saul mustered them at Bezek the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
They told the messengers who had come Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead By the time the sun is hot tomorrow you will be delivered.  When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh they were elated.
They said to the Ammonites Tomorrow we will surrender to you and you can do to us whatever seems good to you.
The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered so that no two of them were left together.
The people then said to Samuel Who was it that asked Shall Saul reign over us? Bring these men to us and we will put them to death.
But Saul said No one shall be put to death today for this day the Lord has rescued Israel.
Then Samuel said to the people Come let us go to Gilgal and there reaffirm the kingship.
So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the Lord. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the Lord and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration.
Samuel said to all Israel I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you.
Now you have a king as your leader. As for me I am old and gray and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day.
Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the Lord and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these I will make it right.
You have not cheated or oppressed us they replied. You have not taken anything from anyones hand.
Samuel said to them The Lord is witness against you and also his anointed is witness this day that you have not found anything in my hand. He is witness they said.
Then Samuel said to the people It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your forefathers up out of Egypt.
Now then stand here because I am going to confront you with evidence before the Lord as to all the righteous acts performed by the Lord for you and your fathers.
After Jacob entered Egypt they cried to the Lord for help and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron who brought your forefathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
But they forgot the Lord their God so he sold them into the hand of Sisera the commander of the army of Hazor and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab who fought against them.
They cried out to the Lord and said We have sinned we have forsaken the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies and we will serve you.
Then the Lord sent JerubBaal Barak Jephthah and Samuel and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side so that you lived securely.
But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you you said to me No we want a king to rule over useven though the Lord your God was your king.
Now here is the king you have chosen the one you asked for see the Lord has set a king over you.
If you fear the Lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your Godgood!
But if you do not obey the Lord and if you rebel against his commands his hand will be against you as it was against your fathers.
Now then stand still and see this great thing the Lord is about to do before your eyes!
Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call upon the Lord to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the Lord when you asked for a king.
Then Samuel called upon the Lord and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the Lord and of Samuel.
The people all said to Samuel Pray to the Lord your God for your servants so that we will not die for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.
Do not be afraid Samuel replied. You have done all this evil yet do not turn away from the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart.
Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good nor can they rescue you because they are useless.
For the sake of his great name the Lord will not reject his people because the Lord was pleased to make you his own.
Saul was thirty years old when he became king and he reigned over Israel forty two years.
Saul chose three thousand men from Israel two thousand were with him at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.
Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said Let the Hebrews hear!
So all Israel heard the news Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
The Philistines assembled to fight Israel with three thousand chariots six thousand charioteers and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash east of Beth Aven.
When the men of Israel saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed they hid in caves and thickets among the rocks and in pits and cisterns.
Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.
He waited seven days the time set by Samuel but Samuel did not come to Gilgal and Sauls men began to scatter.
So he said Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. And Saul offered up the burnt offering.
Just as he finished making the offering Samuel arrived and Saul went out to greet him.
What have you done? asked Samuel. Saul replied When I saw that the men were scattering and that you did not come at the set time and that the Philistines were assembling at Micmash
I thought Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal and I have not sought the Lords favor. So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.
You acted foolishly Samuel said. You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you if you had he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
But now your kingdom will not endure the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people because you have not kept the Lords command.
Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.
Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Micmash.
Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual
another toward Beth Horon and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the desert.
Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel because the Philistines had said Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!
So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares mattocks axes and sickles sharpened.
The price was two thirds of a shekel for sharpening plowshares and mattocks and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.
So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash.
One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor Come lets go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side. But he did not tell his father.
Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men
among whom was Ahijah who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabods brother Ahitub son of Phinehas the son of Eli the Lords priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.
On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff one was called Bozez and the other Seneh.
One cliff stood to the north toward Micmash the other to the south toward Geba.
Jonathan said to his young armorbearer Come lets go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the Lord will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving whether by many or by few.
Do all that you have in mind his armorbearer said. Go ahead I am with you heart and soul.
Jonathan said Come then we will cross over toward the men and let them see us.
If they say to us Wait there until we come to you we will stay where we are and not go up to them.
But if they say Come up to us we will climb up because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands.
So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. Look! said the Philistines. The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.
The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armorbearer Come up to us and well teach you a lesson. So Jonathan said to his armorbearer Climb up after me the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.
Jonathan climbed up using his hands and feet with his armorbearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan and his armorbearer followed and killed behind him.
In that first attack Jonathan and his armorbearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.
Then panic struck the whole armythose in the camp and field and those in the outposts and raiding partiesand the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.
Sauls lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.
Then Saul said to the men who were with him Muster the forces and see who has left us. When they did it was Jonathan and his armorbearer who were not there.
Saul said to Ahijah Bring the ark of God.
While Saul was talking to the priest the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest Withdraw your hand.
Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion striking each other with their swords.
Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run they joined the battle in hot pursuit.
So the Lord rescued Israel that day and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.
Now the men of Israel were in distress that day because Saul had bound the people under an oath saying Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes before I have avenged myself on my enemies! So none of the troops tasted food.
The entire army entered the woods and there was honey on the ground.
When they went into the woods they saw the honey oozing out yet no one put his hand to his mouth because they feared the oath.
But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth and his eyes brightened.
Then one of the soldiers told him Your father bound the army under a strict oath saying Cursed be any man who eats food today! That is why the men are faint.
Jonathan said My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey.
How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?
That day after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon they were exhausted.
They pounced on the plunder and taking sheep cattle and calves they butchered them on the ground and ate them together with the blood.
Then someone said to Saul Look the men are sinning against the Lord by eating meat that has blood in it. You have broken faith he said. Roll a large stone over here at once.
Then he said Go out among the men and tell them Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it.  So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.
Samuel said to Saul I am the one the Lord sent to anoint you king over his people Israel so listen now to the message from the Lord.
This is what the Lord Almighty says I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt.
Now go attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them put to death men and women children and infants cattle and sheep camels and donkeys. 
So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaimtwo hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah.
Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.
Then he said to the Kenites Go away leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur to the east of Egypt.
He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.
But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle the fat calves and lambseverything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.
Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel
I am grieved that I have made Saul king because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions. Samuel was troubled and he cried out to the Lord all that night.
Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul but he was told Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.
When Samuel reached him Saul said The Lord bless you! I have carried out the Lords instructions.
But Samuel said What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?
Saul answered The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God but we totally destroyed the rest.
Stop! Samuel said to Saul. Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night. Tell me Saul replied.
Samuel said Although you were once small in your own eyes did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel.
And he sent you on a mission saying Go and completely destroy those wicked people the Amalekites make war on them until you have wiped them out.
Why did you not obey the Lord? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the Lord?
But I did obey the Lord Saul said. I went on the mission the Lord assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.
The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder the best of what was devoted to God in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal.
But Samuel replied Does the Lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the Lord? To obey is better than sacrifice and to heed is better than the fat of rams.
The Lord said to Samuel How long will you mourn for Saul since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.
But Samuel said How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me. The Lord said Take a heifer with you and say I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.
Invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.
Samuel did what the Lord said. When he arrived at Bethlehem the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked Do you come in peace?
Samuel replied Yes in peace I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me. Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
When they arrived Samuel saw Eliab and thought Surely the Lords anointed stands here before the Lord.
But the Lord said to Samuel Do not consider his appearance or his height for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance but the Lord looks at the heart.
Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said The Lord has not chosen this one either.
Jesse then had Shammah pass by but Samuel said Nor has the Lord chosen this one.
Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel but Samuel said to him The Lord has not chosen these.
So he asked Jesse Are these all the sons you have? There is still the youngest Jesse answered but he is tending the sheep. Samuel said Send for him we will not sit down until he arrives.
So he sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy with a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the Lord said Rise and anoint him he is the one.
So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came upon David in power. Samuel then went to Ramah.
Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.
Sauls attendants said to him See an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the harp. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes upon you and you will feel better.
So Saul said to his attendants Find someone who plays well and bring him to me.
One of the servants answered I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a finelooking man. And the Lord is with him.
Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said Send me your son David who is with the sheep.
So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.
David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much and David became one of his armorbearers.
Then Saul sent word to Jesse saying Allow David to remain in my service for I am pleased with him.
Whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul David would take his harp and play. Then relief would come to Saul he would feel better and the evil spirit would leave him.
Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim between Socoh and Azekah.
Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines.
The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another with the valley between them.
A champion named Goliath who was from Gath came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall.
He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels
on his legs he wore bronze greaves and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.
His spear shaft was like a weavers rod and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him.
Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me.
If he is able to fight and kill me we will become your subjects but if I overcome him and kill him you will become our subjects and serve us.
Then the Philistine said This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.
On hearing the Philistines words Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.
Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons and in Sauls time he was old and well advanced in years.
Jesses three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war The firstborn was Eliab the second Abinadab and the third Shammah.
David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul
but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his fathers sheep at Bethlehem.
For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.
Now Jesse said to his son David Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.
Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them.
They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah fighting against the Philistines.
Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd loaded up and set out as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions shouting the war cry.
Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other.
David left his things with the keeper of supplies ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers.
As he was talking with them Goliath the Philistine champion from Gath stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance and David heard it.
When the Israelites saw the man they all ran from him in great fear.
Now the Israelites had been saying Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his fathers family from taxes in Israel.
David asked the men standing near him What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?
They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him This is what will be done for the man who kills him.
When Eliab Davids oldest brother heard him speaking with the men he burned with anger at him and asked Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is you came down only to watch the battle.
Now what have I done? said David. Cant I even speak?
After David had finished talking with Saul Jonathan became one in spirit with David and he loved him as himself.
From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his fathers house.
And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.
Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David along with his tunic and even his sword his bow and his belt.
Whatever Saul sent him to do David did it so successfully that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people and Sauls officers as well.
When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes.
As they danced they sang Saul has slain his thousands and David his tens of thousands.
Saul was very angry this refrain galled him. They have credited David with tens of thousands he thought but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?
And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house while David was playing the harp as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand
and he hurled it saying to himself Ill pin David to the wall. But David eluded him twice.
Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with David but had left Saul.
So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men and David led the troops in their campaigns.
In everything he did he had great success because the Lord was with him.
When Saul saw how successful he was he was afraid of him.
But all Israel and Judah loved David because he led them in their campaigns.
Saul said to David Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord. For Saul said to himself I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!
But David said to Saul Who am I and what is my family or my fathers clan in Israel that I should become the kings soninlaw?
So when the time came for Merab Sauls daughter to be given to David she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.
Now Sauls daughter Michal was in love with David and when they told Saul about it he was pleased.
I will give her to him he thought so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. So Saul said to David Now you have a second opportunity to become my soninlaw.
Then Saul ordered his attendants Speak to David privately and say Look the king is pleased with you and his attendants all like you now become his soninlaw. 
They repeated these words to David. But David said Do you think it is a small matter to become the kings soninlaw? Im only a poor man and little known.
Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David
and warned him My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning go into hiding and stay there.
I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. Ill speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.
Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him Let not the king do wrong to his servant David he has not wronged you and what he has done has benefited you greatly.
He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The Lord won a great victory for all Israel and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?
Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath As surely as the Lord lives David will not be put to death.
So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul and David was with Saul as before.
Once more war broke out and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.
But an evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp
Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.
Saul sent men to Davids house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal Davids wife warned him If you dont run for your life tonight tomorrow youll be killed.
So Michal let David down through a window and he fled and escaped.
Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed covering it with a garment and putting some goats hair at the head.
When Saul sent the men to capture David Michal said He is ill.
Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him.
But when the men entered there was the idol in the bed and at the head was some goats hair.
Saul said to Michal Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped? Michal told him He said to me Let me get away. Why should I kill you? 
When David had fled and made his escape he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.
Word came to Saul David is in Naioth at Ramah
so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying with Samuel standing there as their leader the Spirit of God came upon Sauls men and they also prophesied.
Saul was told about it and he sent more men and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time and they also prophesied.
Finally he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked Where are Samuel and David? Over in Naioth at Ramah they said.
So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.
He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuels presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say Is Saul also among the prophets?
Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father that he is trying to take my life?
Never! Jonathan replied. You are not going to die! Look my father doesnt do anything great or small without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? Its not so!
But David took an oath and said Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes and he has said to himself Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved. Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live there is only a step between me and death.
Jonathan said to David Whatever you want me to do Ill do for you.
So David said Look tomorrow is the New Moon festival and I am supposed to dine with the king but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.
If your father misses me at all tell him David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem his hometown because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.
If he says Very well then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.
As for you show kindness to your servant for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the Lord. If I am guilty then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?
Never! Jonathan said. If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you wouldnt I tell you?
David asked Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?
Come Jonathan said lets go out into the field. So they went there together.
Then Jonathan said to David By the Lord the God of Israel I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you will I not send you word and let you know?
But if my father is inclined to harm you may the Lord deal with me be it ever so severely if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father.
But show me unfailing kindness like that of the Lord as long as I live so that I may not be killed
David went to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him and asked Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?
David answered Ahimelech the priest The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions. As for my men I have told them to meet me at a certain place.
Now then what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.
But the priest answered David I dont have any ordinary bread on hand however there is some consecrated bread hereprovided the men have kept themselves from women.
David replied Indeed women have been kept from us as usual whenever I set out. The mens things are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!
So the priest gave him the consecrated bread since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.
Now one of Sauls servants was there that day detained before the Lord he was Doeg the Edomite Sauls head shepherd.
David asked Ahimelech Dont you have a spear or a sword here? I havent brought my sword or any other weapon because the kings business was urgent.
The priest replied The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you killed in the Valley of Elah is here it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it take it there is no sword here but that one. David said There is none like it give it to me.
That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.
But the servants of Achish said to him Isnt this David the king of the land? Isnt he the one they sing about in their dances  Saul has slain his thousands and David his tens of thousands?
David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.
So he pretended to be insane in their presence and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.
Achish said to his servants Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?
Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?
David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his fathers household heard about it they went down to him there.
All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?
So he left them with the king of Moab and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.
But the prophet Gad said to David Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah. So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul spear in hand was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah with all his officials standing around him.
Saul said to them Listen men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me as he does today.
But Doeg the Edomite who was standing with Sauls officials said I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
Ahimelech inquired of the Lord for him he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his fathers whole family who were the priests at Nob and they all came to the king.
Saul said Listen now son of Ahitub. Yes my lord he answered.
Saul said to him Why have you conspired against me you and the son of Jesse giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me as he does today?
Ahimelech answered the king Who of all your servants is as loyal as David the kings soninlaw captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?
Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his fathers family for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair.
But the king said You will surely die Ahimelech you and your fathers whole family.
Then the king ordered the guards at his side Turn and kill the priests of the Lord because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing yet they did not tell me. But the kings officials were not willing to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord.
The king then ordered Doeg You turn and strike down the priests. So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eightyfive men who wore the linen ephod.
He also put to the sword Nob the town of the priests with its men and women its children and infants and its cattle donkeys and sheep.
But Abiathar a son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped and fled to join David.
He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord.
Then David said to Abiathar That day when Doeg the Edomite was there I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your fathers whole family.
Stay with me dont be afraid the man who is seeking your life is seeking mine also. You will be safe with me.
When David was told Look the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors
he inquired of the Lord saying Shall I go and attack these Philistines? The Lord answered him Go attack the Philistines and save Keilah.
But Davids men said to him Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!
Once again David inquired of the Lord and the Lord answered him Go down to Keilah for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand.
So David and his men went to Keilah fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.

Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah and he said God has handed him over to me for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars.
And Saul called up all his forces for battle to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
When David learned that Saul was plotting against him he said to Abiathar the priest Bring the ephod.
David said O Lord God of Israel your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.
Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Lord God of Israel tell your servant. And the Lord said He will.
Again David asked Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul? And the Lord said They will.
So David and his men about six hundred in number left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah he did not go there.
David stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him but God did not give David into his hands.
While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.
And Sauls son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.
Dont be afraid he said. My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.
The two of them made a covenant before the Lord. Then Jonathan went home but David remained at Horesh.
The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah south of Jeshimon?
Now O king come down whenever it pleases you to do so and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king.
Saul replied The Lord bless you for your concern for me.
After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines he was told David is in the Desert of En Gedi.
So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.
He came to the sheep pens along the way a cave was there and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.
The men said This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said to you I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.  Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Sauls robe.
Afterward David was consciencestricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.
He said to his men The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lords anointed or lift my hand against him for he is the anointed of the Lord.
With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.
Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul My lord the king! When Saul looked behind him David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.
He said to Saul Why do you listen when men say David is bent on harming you?
This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you but I spared you I said I will not lift my hand against my master because he is the Lords anointed.
See my father look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you but you are hunting me down to take my life.
May the Lord judge between you and me. And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me but my hand will not touch you.
As the old saying goes From evildoers come evil deeds so my hand will not touch you.
Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?
May the Lord be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.
When David finished saying this Saul asked Is that your voice David my son? And he wept aloud.
You are more righteous than I he said. You have treated me well but I have treated you badly.
You have just now told me of the good you did to me the Lord delivered me into your hands but you did not kill me.
When a man finds his enemy does he let him get away unharmed? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today.
I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my fathers family.
So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
Now Samuel died and all Israel assembled and mourned for him and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Maon.
A certain man in Maon who had property there at Carmel was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep which he was shearing in Carmel.
His name was Nabal and his wifes name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman but her husband a Calebite was surly and mean in his dealings.
While David was in the desert he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.
So he sent ten young men and said to them Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.
Say to him Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!
 Now I hear that it is sheepshearing time. When your shepherds were with us we did not mistreat them and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing.
Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them. 
When Davids men arrived they gave Nabal this message in Davids name. Then they waited.
Nabal answered Davids servants Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.
Why should I take my bread and water and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers and give it to men coming from who knows where?
Davids men turned around and went back. When they arrived they reported every word.
David said to his men Put on your swords! So they put on their swords and David put on his. About four hundred men went up with David while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
One of the servants told Nabals wife Abigail David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings but he hurled insults at them.
Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.
Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them.
Now think it over and see what you can do because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.
Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread two skins of wine five dressed sheep five seahs of roasted grain a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs and loaded them on donkeys.
Then she told her servants Go on ahead Ill follow you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine there were David and his men descending toward her and she met them.
David had just said Its been uselessall my watching over this fellows property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.
May God deal with David be it ever so severely if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!
When Abigail saw David she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.
She fell at his feet and said My lord let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you hear what your servant has to say.
The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah which faces Jeshimon?
So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph with his three thousand chosen men of Israel to search there for David.
Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there
he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived.
Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner the commander of the army had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp with the army encamped around him.
David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah Joabs brother Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul? Ill go with you said Abishai.
So David and Abishai went to the army by night and there was Saul lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.
Abishai said to David Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear I wont strike him twice.
But David said to Abishai Dont destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the Lords anointed and be guiltless?
As surely as the Lord lives he said the Lord himself will strike him either his time will come and he will die or he will go into battle and perish.
But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lords anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head and lets go.
But David thought to himself One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel and I will slip out of his hand.
So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.
David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him and David had his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel the widow of Nabal.
When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath he no longer searched for him.
Then David said to Achish If I have found favor in your eyes let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?
So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.
David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.
Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites the Girzites and the Amalekites.
Whenever David attacked an area he did not leave a man or woman alive but took sheep and cattle donkeys and camels and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.
When Achish asked Where did you go raiding today? David would say Against the Negev of Judah or Against the Negev of Jerahmeel or Against the Negev of the Kenites.
He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath for he thought They might inform on us and say This is what David did.  And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.
Achish trusted David and said to himself He has become so odious to his people the Israelites that he will be my servant forever.
In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.
David said Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do. Achish replied Very well I will make you my bodyguard for life.
Now Samuel was dead and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.
The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa.
When Saul saw the Philistine army he was afraid terror filled his heart.
He inquired of the Lord but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.
Saul then said to his attendants Find me a woman who is a medium so I may go and inquire of her. There is one in Endor they said.
So Saul disguised himself putting on other clothes and at night he and two men went to the woman. Consult a spirit for me he said and bring up for me the one I name.
But the woman said to him Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?
Saul swore to her by the Lord As surely as the Lord lives you will not be punished for this.
The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel.
As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish.
The commanders of the Philistines asked What about these Hebrews? Achish replied Is this not David who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year and from the day he left Saul until now I have found no fault in him.
But the Philistine commanders were angry with him and said Send the man back that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his masters favor than by taking the heads of our own men?
Isnt this the David they sang about in their dances  Saul has slain his thousands and David his tens of thousands?
So Achish called David and said to him As surely as the Lord lives you have been reliable and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until now I have found no fault in you but the rulers dont approve of you.
Turn back and go in peace do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers.
But what have I done? asked David. What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why cant I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
Achish answered I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God nevertheless the Philistine commanders have said He must not go up with us into battle.
Now get up early along with your masters servants who have come with you and leave in the morning as soon as it is light.
So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it
and had taken captive the women and all who were in it both young and old. They killed none of them but carried them off as they went on their way.
When David and his men came to Ziklag they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.
Davids two wives had been capturedAhinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the Lord his God.
Then David said to Abiathar the priest the son of Ahimelech Bring me the ephod. Abiathar brought it to him
and David inquired of the Lord Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them? Pursue them he answered. You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue.
David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine where some stayed behind
for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine. But David and four hundred men continued the pursuit.
They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat
part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.
Now the Philistines fought against Israel the Israelites fled before them and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons and they killed his sons Jonathan Abinadab and MalkiShua.
The fighting grew fierce around Saul and when the archers overtook him they wounded him critically.
Saul said to his armorbearer Draw your sword and run me through or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me. But his armorbearer was terrified and would not do it so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
When the armorbearer saw that Saul was dead he too fell on his sword and died with him.
So Saul and his three sons and his armorbearer and all his men died together that same day.
They cut off his head and stripped off his armor and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.
They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard of what the Philistines had done to Saul
all their valiant men journeyed through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh where they burned them.
Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh and they fasted seven days.
After the death of Saul David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.
On the third day a man arrived from Sauls camp with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David he fell to the ground to pay him honor.
Where have you come from? David asked him. He answered I have escaped from the Israelite camp.
What happened? David asked. Tell me. He said The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.
Then David said to the young man who brought him the report How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?
I happened to be on Mount Gilboa the young man said and there was Saul leaning on his spear with the chariots and riders almost upon him.
When he turned around and saw me he called out to me and I said What can I do?
He asked me Who are you?  An Amalekite I answered.
Then he said to me Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death but Im still alive.
So I stood over him and killed him because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.
Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.
They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan and for the army of the Lord and the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.
David said to the young man who brought him the report Where are you from? I am the son of an alien an Amalekite he answered.
David asked him Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lords anointed?
Then David called one of his men and said Go strike him down! So he struck him down and he died.
For David had said to him Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said I killed the Lords anointed. 
David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan
and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow 
Your glory O Israel lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!
Tell it not in Gath proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.
O mountains of Gilboa may you have neither dew nor rain nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled the shield of Saulno longer rubbed with oil.
From the blood of the slain from the flesh of the mighty the bow of Jonathan did not turn back the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.
Saul and Jonathan in life they were loved and gracious and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions.
O daughters of Israel weep for Saul who clothed you in scarlet and finery who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.
How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
I grieve for you Jonathan my brother you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful more wonderful than that of women.
How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!
In the course of time David inquired of the Lord. Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah? he asked. The Lord said Go up. David asked Where shall I go? To Hebron the Lord answered.
So David went up there with his two wives Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
David also took the men who were with him each with his family and they settled in Hebron and its towns.
Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul
he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them The Lord bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.
May the Lord now show you kindness and faithfulness and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.
Now then be strong and brave for Saul your master is dead and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.
Meanwhile Abner son of Ner the commander of Sauls army had taken IshBosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.
He made him king over Gilead Ashuri and Jezreel and also over Ephraim Benjamin and all Israel.
IshBosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel and he reigned two years. The house of Judah however followed David.
The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
Abner son of Ner together with the men of IshBosheth son of Saul left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.
Joab son of Zeruiah and Davids men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.
Then Abner said to Joab Lets have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us. All right let them do it Joab said.
So they stood up and were counted offtwelve men for Benjamin and IshBosheth son of Saul and twelve for David.
Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponents side and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.
The battle that day was very fierce and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by Davids men.
The three sons of Zeruiah were there Joab Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleetfooted as a wild gazelle.
He chased Abner turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.
Abner looked behind him and asked Is that you Asahel? It is he answered.
Then Abner said to him Turn aside to the right or to the left take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons. But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
Again Abner warned Asahel Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?
But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahels stomach and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.
But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner and as the sun was setting they came to the hill of Ammah near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.
Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.
Abner called out to Joab Must the sword devour forever? Dont you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?
Joab answered As surely as God lives if you had not spoken the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning.
So Joab blew the trumpet and all the men came to a halt they no longer pursued Israel nor did they fight anymore.
All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan continued through the whole Bithron and came to Mahanaim.
Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel nineteen of Davids men were found missing.
But Davids men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.
They took Asahel and buried him in his fathers tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
Sons were born to David in Hebron His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel
his second Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel the third Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur
the fourth Adonijah the son of Haggith the fifth Shephatiah the son of Abital
and the sixth Ithream the son of Davids wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
Abner was very angry because of what IshBosheth said and he answered Am I a dogs headon Judahs side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I havent handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!
May God deal with Abner be it ever so severely if I do not do for David what the Lord promised him on oath
and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish Davids throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.
IshBosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner because he was afraid of him.
When IshBosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron he lost courage and all Israel became alarmed.
Now Sauls son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Recab they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of BenjaminBeeroth is considered part of Benjamin
because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have lived there as aliens to this day.

Now Recab and Baanah the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite set out for the house of IshBosheth and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest.
They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah slipped away.
They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him they cut off his head. Taking it with them they traveled all night by way of the Arabah.
They brought the head of IshBosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king Here is the head of IshBosheth son of Saul your enemy who tried to take your life. This day the Lord has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.
David answered Recab and his brother Baanah the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite As surely as the Lord lives who has delivered me out of all trouble
when a man told me Saul is dead and thought he was bringing good news I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news!
How much morewhen wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bedshould I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!
So David gave an order to his men and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of IshBosheth and buried it in Abners tomb at Hebron.
All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said We are your own flesh and blood.
In the past while Saul was king over us you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the Lord said to you You will shepherd my people Israel and you will become their ruler. 
When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron the king made a compact with them at Hebron before the Lord and they anointed David king over Israel.
David was thirty years old when he became king and he reigned forty years.
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirtythree years.
The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites who lived there. The Jebusites said to David You will not get in here even the blind and the lame can ward you off. They thought David cannot get in here.
Nevertheless David captured the fortress of Zion the City of David.
On that day David said Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those lame and blind who are Davids enemies. That is why they say The blind and lame will not enter the palace.
David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it from the supporting terraces inward.
And he became more and more powerful because the Lord God Almighty was with him.
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons and they built a palace for David.
And David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
After he left Hebron David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem and more sons and daughters were born to him.
These are the names of the children born to him there Shammua Shobab Nathan Solomon
Ibhar Elishua Nepheg Japhia
Elishama Eliada and Eliphelet.
When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel they went up in full force to search for him but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.
Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim
so David inquired of the Lord Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me? The Lord answered him Go for I will surely hand the Philistines over to you.
So David went to Baal Perazim and there he defeated them. He said As waters break out the Lord has broken out against my enemies before me. So that place was called Baal Perazim.
The Philistines abandoned their idols there and David and his men carried them off.
Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim
David again brought together out of Israel chosen men thirty thousand in all.
He and all his men set out from Baalah of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the Name the name of the Lord Almighty who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark.
They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio sons of Abinadab were guiding the new cart
with the ark of God on it and Ahio was walking in front of it.
David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all their might before the Lord with songs and with harps lyres tambourines sistrums and cymbals.
When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God because the oxen stumbled.
The Lords anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God.
Then David was angry because the Lords wrath had broken out against Uzzah and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.
David was afraid of the Lord that day and said How can the ark of the Lord ever come to me?
Now King David was told The Lord has blessed the household of ObedEdom and everything he has because of the ark of God. So David went down and brought up the ark of God from the house of ObedEdom to the City of David with rejoicing.
When those who were carrying the ark of the Lord had taken six steps he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.
David wearing a linen ephod danced before the Lord with all his might
while he and the entire house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouts and the sound of trumpets.
As the ark of the Lord was entering the City of David Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord she despised him in her heart.
They brought the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the Lord.
After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings he blessed the people in the name of the Lord Almighty.
Then he gave a loaf of bread a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites both men and women. And all the people went to their homes.
When David returned home to bless his household Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!
David said to Michal It was before the Lord who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the Lords people IsraelI will celebrate before the Lord.
I will become even more undignified than this and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of I will be held in honor.
And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
After the king was settled in his palace and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him
he said to Nathan the prophet Here I am living in a palace of cedar while the ark of God remains in a tent.
Nathan replied to the king Whatever you have in mind go ahead and do it for the Lord is with you.
That night the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying
Go and tell my servant David This is what the Lord says Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.
Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel Why have you not built me a house of cedar? 
Now then tell my servant David This is what the Lord Almighty says I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel.
I have been with you wherever you have gone and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great like the names of the greatest men of the earth.
And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore as they did at the beginning
and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies.  The Lord declares to you that the Lord himself will establish a house for you
When your days are over and you rest with your fathers I will raise up your offspring to succeed you who will come from your own body and I will establish his kingdom.
He is the one who will build a house for my Name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
I will be his father and he will be my son. When he does wrong I will punish him with the rod of men with floggings inflicted by men.
But my love will never be taken away from him as I took it away from Saul whom I removed from before you.
Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me your throne will be established forever. 
Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
In the course of time David defeated the Philistines and subdued them and he took Metheg Ammah from the control of the Philistines.
David also defeated the Moabites. He made them lie down on the ground and measured them off with a length of cord. Every two lengths of them were put to death and the third length was allowed to live. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought tribute.
Moreover David fought Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah when he went to restore his control along the Euphrates River.
David captured a thousand of his chariots seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah David struck down twentytwo thousand of them.
He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The Lord gave David victory wherever he went.
David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
From Tebah and Berothai towns that belonged to Hadadezer King David took a great quantity of bronze.
When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer
he sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer who had been at war with Tou. Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze.
King David dedicated these articles to the Lord as he had done with the silver and gold from all the nations he had subdued
Edom and Moab the Ammonites and the Philistines and Amalek. He also dedicated the plunder taken from Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah.
David asked Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathans sake?
Now there was a servant of Sauls household named Ziba. They called him to appear before David and the king said to him Are you Ziba? Your servant he replied.
The king asked Is there no one still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show Gods kindness? Ziba answered the king There is still a son of Jonathan he is crippled in both feet.
Where is he? the king asked. Ziba answered He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.
So King David had him brought from Lo Debar from the house of Makir son of Ammiel.
When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan the son of Saul came to David he bowed down to pay him honor. David said Mephibosheth! Your servant he replied.
Dont be afraid David said to him for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul and you will always eat at my table.
Mephibosheth bowed down and said What is your servant that you should notice a dead dog like me?
Then the king summoned Ziba Sauls servant and said to him I have given your masters grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family.
You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops so that your masters grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth grandson of your master will always eat at my table.
Then Ziba said to the king Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do. So Mephibosheth ate at Davids table like one of the kings sons.
Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica and all the members of Zibas household were servants of Mephibosheth.
And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem because he always ate at the kings table and he was crippled in both feet.
In the course of time the king of the Ammonites died and his son Hanun succeeded him as king.
David thought I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash just as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When Davids men came to the land of the Ammonites
the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun their lord Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Hasnt David sent them to you to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?
So Hanun seized Davids men shaved off half of each mans beard cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks and sent them away.
When David was told about this he sent messengers to meet the men for they were greatly humiliated. The king said Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown and then come back.
When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in Davids nostrils they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah as well as the king of Maacah with a thousand men and also twelve thousand men from Tob.
On hearing this David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.
The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city gate while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.
He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites.
Joab said If the Arameans are too strong for me then you are to come to my rescue but if the Ammonites are too strong for you then I will come to rescue you.
Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The Lord will do what is good in his sight.
Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans and they fled before him.
When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel they regrouped.
Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the River they went to Helam with Shobach the commander of Hadadezers army leading them.
When David was told of this he gathered all Israel crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet David and fought against him.
But they fled before Israel and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach the commander of their army and he died there.
When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
In the spring at the time when kings go off to war David sent Joab out with the kings men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.
One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful
and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said Isnt this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him and he slept with her.  Then she went back home.
The woman conceived and sent word to David saying I am pregnant.
So David sent this word to Joab Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent him to David.
When Uriah came to him David asked him how Joab was how the soldiers were and how the war was going.
Then David said to Uriah Go down to your house and wash your feet. So Uriah left the palace and a gift from the king was sent after him.
But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his masters servants and did not go down to his house.
When David was told Uriah did not go home he asked him Havent you just come from a distance? Why didnt you go home?
Uriah said to David The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents and my master Joab and my lords men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As surely as you live I will not do such a thing!
Then David said to him Stay here one more day and tomorrow I will send you back. So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
At Davids invitation he ate and drank with him and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his masters servants he did not go home.
In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
In it he wrote Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.
So while Joab had the city under siege he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were.
When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab some of the men in Davids army fell moreover Uriah the Hittite died.
Joab sent David a full account of the battle.
He instructed the messenger When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle
the kings anger may flare up and he may ask you Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didnt you know they would shoot arrows from the wall?
Who killed Abimelech son of JerubBesheth? Didnt a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall? If he asks you this then say to him Also your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead. 
The messenger set out and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.
The messenger said to David The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open but we drove them back to the entrance to the city gate.
Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall and some of the kings men died. Moreover your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.
David told the messenger Say this to Joab Dont let this upset you the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it. Say this to encourage Joab.
When Uriahs wife heard that her husband was dead she mourned for him.
After the time of mourning was over David had her brought to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the Lord.
The Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to him he said There were two men in a certain town one rich and the other poor.
The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle
but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.
Now a traveler came to the rich man but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.
David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan As surely as the Lord lives the man who did this deserves to die!
He must pay for that lamb four times over because he did such a thing and had no pity.
Then Nathan said to David You are the man! This is what the Lord the God of Israel says I anointed you king over Israel and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
I gave your masters house to you and your masters wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little I would have given you even more.
Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.
This is what the Lord says Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.
You did it in secret but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel. 
Then David said to Nathan I have sinned against the Lord. Nathan replied The Lord has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.
But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt the son born to you will die.
After Nathan had gone home the Lord struck the child that Uriahs wife had borne to David and he became ill.
David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground.
The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground but he refused and he would not eat any food with them.
On the seventh day the child died. Davids servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead for they thought While the child was still living we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.
David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. Is the child dead? he asked. Yes they replied he is dead.
Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed put on lotions and changed his clothes he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house and at his request they served him food and he ate.
His servants asked him Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive you fasted and wept but now that the child is dead you get up and eat!
He answered While the child was still alive I fasted and wept. I thought Who knows? The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live.
But now that he is dead why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him but he will not return to me.
Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and he went to her and lay with her. She gave birth to a son and they named him Solomon. The Lord loved him
and because the Lord loved him he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.
Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel.
Joab then sent messengers to David saying I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply.
Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city and it will be named after me.
So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah and attacked and captured it.
He took the crown from the head of their king its weight was a talent of gold and it was set with precious stonesand it was placed on Davids head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city
and brought out the people who were there consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes and he made them work at brickmaking. He did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
In the course of time Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.
Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.
Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah Davids brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
He asked Amnon Why do you the kings son look so haggard morning after morning? Wont you tell me? Amnon said to him Im in love with Tamar my brother Absaloms sister.
Go to bed and pretend to be ill Jonadab said. When your father comes to see you say to him I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand. 
So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him Amnon said to him I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight so I may eat from her hand.
David sent word to Tamar at the palace Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.
So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon who was lying down. She took some dough kneaded it made the bread in his sight and baked it.
Then she took the pan and served him the bread but he refused to eat. Send everyone out of here Amnon said. So everyone left him.
Then Amnon said to Tamar Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.
But when she took it to him to eat he grabbed her and said Come to bed with me my sister.
Dont my brother! she said to him. Dont force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Dont do this wicked thing.
What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king he will not keep me from being married to you.
But he refused to listen to her and since he was stronger than she he raped her.
Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her Get up and get out!
No! she said to him. Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me. But he refused to listen to her.
He called his personal servant and said Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her.
So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented robe for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.
Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away weeping aloud as she went.
Her brother Absalom said to her Has that Amnon your brother been with you? Be quiet now my sister he is your brother. Dont take this thing to heart. And Tamar lived in her brother Absaloms house a desolate woman.
When King David heard all this he was furious.
Absalom never said a word to Amnon either good or bad he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.
Two years later when Absaloms sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim he invited all the kings sons to come there.
Absalom went to the king and said Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?
No my son the king replied. All of us should not go we would only be a burden to you. Although Absalom urged him he still refused to go but gave him his blessing.
Then Absalom said If not please let my brother Amnon come with us. The king asked him Why should he go with you?
But Absalom urged him so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the kings sons.
Absalom ordered his men Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you Strike Amnon down then kill him. Dont be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave.
So Absaloms men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the kings sons got up mounted their mules and fled.
While they were on their way the report came to David Absalom has struck down all the kings sons not one of them is left.
The king stood up tore his clothes and lay down on the ground and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
But Jonadab son of Shimeah Davids brother said My lord should not think that they killed all the princes only Amnon is dead. This has been Absaloms expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the kings heart longed for Absalom.
So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes and dont use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.
Then go to the king and speak these words to him. And Joab put the words in her mouth.
When the woman from Tekoa went to the king she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor and she said Help me O king!
The king asked her What is troubling you? She said I am indeed a widow my husband is dead.
I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.
Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant they say Hand over the one who struck his brother down so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed then we will get rid of the heir as well. They would put out the only burning coal I have left leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth.
The king said to the woman Go home and I will issue an order in your behalf.
But the woman from Tekoa said to him My lord the king let the blame rest on me and on my fathers family and let the king and his throne be without guilt.
The king replied If anyone says anything to you bring him to me and he will not bother you again.
She said Then let the king invoke the Lord his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction so that my son will not be destroyed. As surely as the Lord lives he said not one hair of your sons head will fall to the ground.
Then the woman said Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king. Speak he replied.
The woman said Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this does he not convict himself for the king has not brought back his banished son?
Like water spilled on the ground which cannot be recovered so we must die. But God does not take away life instead he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him.
And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought I will speak to the king perhaps he will do what his servant asks.
Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from the inheritance God gave us.
And now your servant says May the word of my lord the king bring me rest for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you. 
Then the king said to the woman Do not keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you. Let my lord the king speak the woman said.
The king asked Isnt the hand of Joab with you in all this? The woman answered As surely as you live my lord the king no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.
Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of Godhe knows everything that happens in the land.
The king said to Joab Very well I will do it. Go bring back the young man Absalom.
Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor and he blessed the king. Joab said Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes my lord the king because the king has granted his servants request.
Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
But the king said He must go to his own house he must not see my face. So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.
In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him.
Whenever he cut the hair of his headhe used to cut his hair from time to time when it became too heavy for himhe would weigh it and its weight was two hundred shekels by the royal standard.
Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. The daughters name was Tamar and she became a beautiful woman.
Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the kings face.
Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time but he refused to come.
Then he said to his servants Look Joabs field is next to mine and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire. So Absaloms servants set the field on fire.
Then Joab did go to Absaloms house and he said to him Why have your servants set my field on fire?
Absalom said to Joab Look I sent word to you and said Come here so I can send you to the king to ask Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!  Now then I want to see the kings face and if I am guilty of anything let him put me to death.
So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
In the course of time Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him.
He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision Absalom would call out to him What town are you from? He would answer Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.
Then Absalom would say to him Look your claims are valid and proper but there is no representative of the king to hear you.
And Absalom would add If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that he gets justice.
Also whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him Absalom would reach out his hand take hold of him and kiss him.
Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice and so he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
At the end of four years Absalom said to the king Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the Lord.
While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram I made this vow If the Lord takes me back to Jerusalem I will worship the Lord in Hebron. 
The king said to him Go in peace. So he went to Hebron.
Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets then say Absalom is king in Hebron. 
Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently knowing nothing about the matter.
While Absalom was offering sacrifices he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Davids counselor to come from Giloh his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength and Absaloms following kept on increasing.
A messenger came and told David The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.
Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem Come! We must flee or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword.
The kings officials answered him Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses.
The king set out with his entire household following him but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace.
So the king set out with all the people following him and they halted at a place some distance away.
All his men marched past him along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king.
The king said to Ittai the Gittite Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner an exile from your homeland.
You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us when I do not know where I am going? Go back and take your countrymen. May kindness and faithfulness be with you.
But Ittai replied to the king As surely as the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives wherever my lord the king may be whether it means life or death there will your servant be.
David said to Ittai Go ahead march on. So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him.
When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit there was Ziba the steward of Mephibosheth waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread a hundred cakes of raisins a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine.
The king asked Ziba Why have you brought these? Ziba answered The donkeys are for the kings household to ride on the bread and fruit are for the men to eat and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert.
The king then asked Where is your masters grandson? Ziba said to him He is staying in Jerusalem because he thinks Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfathers kingdom. 
Then the king said to Ziba All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours. I humbly bow Ziba said. May I find favor in your eyes my lord the king.
As King David approached Bahurim a man from the same clan as Sauls family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera and he cursed as he came out.
He pelted David and all the kings officials with stones though all the troops and the special guard were on Davids right and left.
As he cursed Shimei said Get out get out you man of blood you scoundrel!
The Lord has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul in whose place you have reigned. The Lord has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a man of blood!
Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head.
But the king said What do you and I have in common you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the Lord said to him Curse David who can ask Why do you do this? 
David then said to Abishai and all his officials My son who is of my own flesh is trying to take my life. How much more then this Benjamite! Leave him alone let him curse for the Lord has told him to.
It may be that the Lord will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today.
So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.
The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.
Meanwhile Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem and Ahithophel was with him.
Then Hushai the Arkite Davids friend went to Absalom and said to him Long live the king! Long live the king!
Absalom asked Hushai Is this the love you show your friend? Why didnt you go with your friend?
Hushai said to Absalom No the one chosen by the Lord by these people and by all the men of Israelhis I will be and I will remain with him.
Furthermore whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father so I will serve you.
Absalom said to Ahithophel Give us your advice. What should we do?
Ahithophel answered Lie with your fathers concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench in your fathers nostrils and the hands of everyone with you will be strengthened.
So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof and he lay with his fathers concubines in the sight of all Israel.
Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophels advice.
Ahithophel said to Absalom I would choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David.
I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king
and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all all the people will be unharmed.
This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.
But Absalom said Summon also Hushai the Arkite so we can hear what he has to say.
When Hushai came to him Absalom said Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not give us your opinion.
Hushai replied to Absalom The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time.
You know your father and his men they are fighters and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides your father is an experienced fighter he will not spend the night with the troops.
Even now he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first whoever hears about it will say There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.
Then even the bravest soldier whose heart is like the heart of a lion will melt with fear for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.
So I advise you Let all Israel from Dan to Beershebaas numerous as the sand on the seashorebe gathered to you with you yourself leading them into battle.
Then we will attack him wherever he may be found and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.
If he withdraws into a city then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a piece of it can be found.
Absalom and all the men of Israel said The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel. For the Lord had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.
Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar the priests Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such but I have advised them to do so and so.
Now send a message immediately and tell David Do not spend the night at the fords in the desert cross over without fail or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up. 
Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A servant girl was to go and inform them and they were to go and tell King David for they could not risk being seen entering the city.
But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left quickly and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard and they climbed down into it.
His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.
When Absaloms men came to the woman at the house they asked Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? The woman answered them They crossed over the brook. The men searched but found no one so they returned to Jerusalem.
After the men had gone the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him Set out and cross the river at once Ahithophel has advised such and such against you.
So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his fathers tomb.
David went to Mahanaim and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether an Israelite who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.
The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
When David came to Mahanaim Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley flour and roasted grain beans and lentils
honey and curds sheep and cheese from cows milk for David and his people to eat. For they said The people have become hungry and tired and thirsty in the desert.
David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
David sent the troops outa third under the command of Joab a third under Joabs brother Abishai son of Zeruiah and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops I myself will surely march out with you.
But the men said You must not go out if we are forced to flee they wont care about us. Even if half of us die they wont care but you are worth ten thousand of us. It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.
The king answered I will do whatever seems best to you. So the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.
The king commanded Joab Abishai and Ittai Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake. And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.
The army marched into the field to fight Israel and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
There the army of Israel was defeated by Davids men and the casualties that day were greattwenty thousand men.
The battle spread out over the whole countryside and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.
Now Absalom happened to meet Davids men. He was riding his mule and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak Absaloms head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair while the mule he was riding kept on going.
When one of the men saw this he told Joab I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.
Joab said to the man who had told him this What! You saw him? Why didnt you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels of silver and a warriors belt.
But the man replied Even if a thousand shekels were weighed out into my hands I would not lift my hand against the kings son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.
And if I had put my life in jeopardy and nothing is hidden from the kingyou would have kept your distance from me.
Joab said Im not going to wait like this for you. So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absaloms heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree.
And ten of Joabs armorbearers surrounded Absalom struck him and killed him.
Then Joab sounded the trumpet and the troops stopped pursuing Israel for Joab halted them.
They took Absalom threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile all the Israelites fled to their homes.
During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the Kings Valley as a monument to himself for he thought I have no son to carry on the memory of my name. He named the pillar after himself and it is called Absaloms Monument to this day.
Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said Let me run and take the news to the king that the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.
You are not the one to take the news today Joab told him. You may take the news another time but you must not do so today because the kings son is dead.
Then Joab said to a Cushite Go tell the king what you have seen. The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.
Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab Come what may please let me run behind the Cushite. But Joab replied My son why do you want to go? You dont have any news that will bring you a reward.
He said Come what may I want to run. So Joab said Run! Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.
While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out he saw a man running alone.
The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said If he is alone he must have good news. And the man came closer and closer.
Then the watchman saw another man running and he called down to the gatekeeper Look another man running alone! The king said He must be bringing good news too.
The watchman said It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok. Hes a good man the king said. He comes with good news.
Then Ahimaaz called out to the king All is well! He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said Praise be to the Lord your God! He has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king.
The king asked Is the young man Absalom safe? Ahimaaz answered I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the kings servant and me your servant but I dont know what it was.
The king said Stand aside and wait here. So he stepped aside and stood there.
Then the Cushite arrived and said My lord the king hear the good news! The Lord has delivered you today from all who rose up against you.
The king asked the Cushite Is the young man Absalom safe? The Cushite replied May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.
The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went he said O my son Absalom! My son my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of youO Absalom my son my son!
Joab was told The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.
And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning because on that day the troops heard it said The king is grieving for his son.
The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.
The king covered his face and cried aloud O my son Absalom! O Absalom my son my son!
Then Joab went into the house to the king and said Today you have humiliated all your men who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.
You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead.
Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the Lord that if you dont go out not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come upon you from your youth till now.
So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told The king is sitting in the gateway they all came before him. Meanwhile the Israelites had fled to their homes.
Throughout the tribes of Israel the people were all arguing with each other saying The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country because of Absalom
and Absalom whom we anointed to rule over us has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?
King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests Ask the elders of Judah Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters?
You are my brothers my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?
And say to Amasa Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me be it ever so severely if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab. 
He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. They sent word to the king Return you and all your men.
Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan.
Shimei son of Gera the Benjamite from Bahurim hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
With him were a thousand Benjamites along with Ziba the steward of Sauls household and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan where the king was.
They crossed at the ford to take the kings household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan he fell prostrate before the king
and said to him May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.
For I your servant know that I have sinned but today I have come here as the first of the whole house of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.
Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said Shouldnt Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the Lords anointed.
David replied What do you and I have in common you sons of Zeruiah? This day you have become my adversaries! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know that today I am king over Israel?
So the king said to Shimei You shall not die. And the king promised him on oath.
Mephibosheth Sauls grandson also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.
When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king the king asked him Why didnt you go with me Mephibosheth?
Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bicri a Benjamite happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted We have no share in David no part in Jesses son! Every man to his tent O Israel!
So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them but did not lie with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death living as widows.
Then the king said to Amasa Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days and be here yourself.
But when Amasa went to summon Judah he took longer than the time the king had set for him.
David said to Abishai Now Sheba son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your masters men and pursue him or he will find fortified cities and escape from us.
So Joabs men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
While they were at the great rock in Gibeon Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward it dropped out of its sheath.
Joab said to Amasa How are you my brother? Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joabs hand and Joab plunged it into his belly and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bicri.
One of Joabs men stood beside Amasa and said Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David let him follow Joab!
Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there. When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him.
After Amasa had been removed from the road all the men went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maacah and through the entire region of the Berites who gathered together and followed him.
All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maacah. They built a siege ramp up to the city and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down
a wise woman called from the city Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him.
He went toward her and she asked Are you Joab? I am he answered. She said Listen to what your servant has to say. Im listening he said.
She continued Long ago they used to say Get your answer at Abel and that settled it.
We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the Lords inheritance?
Far be it from me! Joab replied Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy!
That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bicri from the hill country of Ephraim has lifted up his hand against the king against David. Hand over this one man and Ill withdraw from the city. The woman said to Joab His head will be thrown to you from the wall.
During the reign of David there was a famine for three successive years so David sought the face of the Lord. The Lord said It is on account of Saul and his bloodstained house it is because he put the Gibeonites to death.
The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them.
David asked the Gibeonites What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the Lords inheritance?
The Gibeonites answered him We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death. What do you want me to do for you? David asked.
They answered the king As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel
let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the Lord at Gibeah of Saulthe Lords chosen one. So the king said I will give them to you.
The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan the son of Saul because of the oath before the Lord between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth the two sons of Aiahs daughter Rizpah whom she had borne to Saul together with the five sons of Sauls daughter Merab whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
He handed them over to the Gibeonites who killed and exposed them on a hill before the Lord. All seven of them fell together they were put to death during the first days of the harvest just as the barley harvest was beginning.
Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies she did not let the birds of the air touch them by day or the wild animals by night.
When David was told what Aiahs daughter Rizpah Sauls concubine had done
he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead.
David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up.
They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Sauls father Kish at Zela in Benjamin and did everything the king commanded. After that God answered prayer in behalf of the land.
Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines and he became exhausted.
And IshbiBenob one of the descendants of Rapha whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels and who was armed with a new sword said he would kill David.
But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to Davids rescue he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then Davids men swore to him saying Never again will you go out with us to battle so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished.
In the course of time there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph one of the descendants of Rapha.
In another battle with the Philistines at Gob Elhanan son of JaareOregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite who had a spear with a shaft like a weavers rod.
In still another battle which took place at Gath there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foottwentyfour in all. He also was descended from Rapha.
When he taunted Israel Jonathan son of Shimeah Davids brother killed him.
These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
David sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
He said The Lord is my rock my fortress and my deliverer
my God is my rock in whom I take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation. He is my stronghold my refuge and my savior from violent men you save me.
I call to the Lord who is worthy of praise and I am saved from my enemies.
The waves of death swirled about me the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
The cords of the grave coiled around me the snares of death confronted me.
In my distress I called to the Lord I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice my cry came to his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked the foundations of the heavens shook they trembled because he was angry.
Smoke rose from his nostrils consuming fire came from his mouth burning coals blazed out of it.
He parted the heavens and came down dark clouds were under his feet.
He mounted the cherubim and flew he soared on the wings of the wind.
He made darkness his canopy around him the dark rain clouds of the sky.
Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.
The Lord thundered from heaven the voice of the Most High resounded.
He shot arrows and scattered the enemies bolts of lightning and routed them.
The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the Lord at the blast of breath from his nostrils.
He reached down from on high and took hold of me he drew me out of deep waters.
He brought me out into a spacious place he rescued me because he delighted in me.
The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
For I have kept the ways of the Lord I have not done evil by turning from my God.
All his laws are before me I have not turned away from his decrees.
I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.
The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his sight.
To the faithful you show yourself faithful to the blameless you show yourself blameless
to the pure you show yourself pure but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
You save the humble but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.
You are my lamp O Lord the Lord turns my darkness into light.
With your help I can advance against a troop with my God I can scale a wall.
As for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
For who is God besides the Lord? And who is the Rock except our God?
It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.
He makes my feet like the feet of a deer he enables me to stand on the heights.
He trains my hands for battle my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
You give me your shield of victory you stoop down to make me great.
You broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not turn.
I pursued my enemies and crushed them I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
The God of Israel spoke the Rock of Israel said to me When one rules over men in righteousness when he rules in the fear of God
he is like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning like the brightness after rain that brings the grass from the earth.
Is not my house right with God? Has he not made with me an everlasting covenant arranged and secured in every part? Will he not bring to fruition my salvation and grant me my every desire?
But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns which are not gathered with the hand.
Whoever touches thorns uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear they are burned up where they lie.
These are the names of Davids mighty men JoshebBasshebeth a Tahkemonite was chief of the Three he raised his spear against eight hundred men whom he killed in one encounter.
Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated
but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar but only to strip the dead.
Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils Israels troops fled from them.
But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down and the Lord brought about a great victory.
During harvest time three of the thirty chief men came down to David at the cave of Adullam while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
At that time David was in the stronghold and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
David longed for water and said Oh that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!
So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it instead he poured it out before the Lord.
Far be it from me O Lord to do this! he said. Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives? And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men whom he killed and so he became as famous as the Three.
Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander even though he was not included among them.
Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moabs best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear.
Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada he too was as famous as the three mighty men.
He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
Among the Thirty were Asahel the brother of Joab Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem
Again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel and he incited David against them saying Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.
So the king said to Joab and the army commanders with him Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men so that I may know how many there are.
But Joab replied to the king May the Lord your God multiply the troops a hundred times over and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?
The kings word however overruled Joab and the army commanders so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.
Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.
After they had gone through the entire land they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king In Israel there were eight hundred thousand ablebodied men who could handle a sword and in Judah five hundred thousand.
David was consciencestricken after he had counted the fighting men and he said to the Lord I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now O Lord I beg you take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.
Before David got up the next morning the word of the Lord had come to Gad the prophet Davids seer
Go and tell David This is what the Lord says I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you. 
So Gad went to David and said to him Shall there come upon you three years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.
David said to Gad I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the Lord for his mercy is great but do not let me fall into the hands of men.
So the Lord sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.
When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem the Lord was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was afflicting the people Enough! Withdraw your hand. The angel of the Lord was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
When David saw the angel who was striking down the people he said to the Lord I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my family.
On that day Gad went to David and said to him Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
So David went up as the Lord had commanded through Gad.
When Araunah looked and saw the king and his men coming toward him he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.
Araunah said Why has my lord the king come to his servant? To buy your threshing floor David answered so I can build an altar to the Lord that the plague on the people may be stopped.
Araunah said to David Let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
O king Araunah gives all this to the king. Araunah also said to him May the Lord your God accept you.
But the king replied to Araunah No I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.
David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered prayer in behalf of the land and the plague on Israel was stopped.
When King David was old and well advanced in years he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him.
So his servants said to him Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm.
Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag a Shunammite and brought her to the king.
The girl was very beautiful she took care of the king and waited on him but the king had no intimate relations with her.
Now Adonijah whose mother was Haggith put himself forward and said I will be king. So he got chariots and horses ready with fifty men to run ahead of him.

Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest and they gave him their support.
But Zadok the priest Benaiah son of Jehoiada Nathan the prophet Shimei and Rei and Davids special guard did not join Adonijah.
Adonijah then sacrificed sheep cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers the kings sons and all the men of Judah who were royal officials
but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.
Then Nathan asked Bathsheba Solomons mother Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king without our lord Davids knowing it?
Now then let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
Go in to King David and say to him My lord the king did you not swear to me your servant Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne? Why then has Adonijah become king?
While you are still there talking to the king I will come in and confirm what you have said.
So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.
Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. What is it you want? the king asked.
She said to him My lord you yourself swore to me your servant by the Lord your God Solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne.
But now Adonijah has become king and you my lord the king do not know about it.
He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle fattened calves and sheep and has invited all the kings sons Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army but he has not invited Solomon your servant.
My lord the king the eyes of all Israel are on you to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
Otherwise as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals.
While she was still speaking with the king Nathan the prophet arrived.
Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle fattened calves and sheep. He has invited all the kings sons the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying Long live King Adonijah!
But me your servant and Zadok the priest and Benaiah son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon he did not invite.
Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
Then King David said Call in Bathsheba. So she came into the kings presence and stood before him.
The king then took an oath As surely as the Lord lives who has delivered me out of every trouble
I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the Lord the God of Israel Solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne in my place.
Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and kneeling before the king said May my lord King David live forever!
King David said Call in Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada. When they came before the king
he said to them Take your lords servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.
There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout Long live King Solomon!
Then you are to go up with him and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.
Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king Amen! May the Lord the God of my lord the king so declare it.
As the Lord was with my lord the king so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!
So Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet Benaiah son of Jehoiada the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King Davids mule and escorted him to Gihon.
Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted Long live King Solomon!
And all the people went up after him playing flutes and rejoicing greatly so that the ground shook with the sound.
Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet Joab asked Whats the meaning of all the noise in the city?
Even as he was speaking Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.
Not at all! Jonathan answered. Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
The king has sent with him Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet Benaiah son of Jehoiada the Kerethites and the Pelethites and they have put him on the kings mule
and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering and the city resounds with it. Thats the noise you hear.
When the time drew near for David to die he gave a charge to Solomon his son.
I am about to go the way of all the earth he said. So be strong show yourself a man
and observe what the Lord your God requires Walk in his ways and keep his decrees and commands his laws and requirements as written in the Law of Moses so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go
and that the Lord may keep his promise to me If your descendants watch how they live and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.
Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to mewhat he did to the two commanders of Israels armies Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.
Deal with him according to your wisdom but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.
But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
And remember you have with you Shimei son of Gera the Benjamite from Bahurim who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan I swore to him by the Lord I will not put you to death by the sword.
But now do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.
Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
He had reigned forty years over Israelseven years in Hebron and thirtythree in Jerusalem.
So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David and his rule was firmly established.
Now Adonijah the son of Haggith went to Bathsheba Solomons mother. Bathsheba asked him Do you come peacefully? He answered Yes peacefully.
Then he added I have something to say to you. You may say it she replied.
As you know he said the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed and the kingdom has gone to my brother for it has come to him from the Lord.
Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me. You may make it she said.
So he continued Please ask King Solomonhe will not refuse youto give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.
Very well Bathsheba replied I will speak to the king for you.
When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah the king stood up to meet her bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the kings mother and she sat down at his right hand.
I have one small request to make of you she said. Do not refuse me. The king replied Make it my mother I will not refuse you.
So she said Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.
King Solomon answered his mother Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for himafter all he is my older brotheryes for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!
Then King Solomon swore by the Lord May God deal with me be it ever so severely if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!
And now as surely as the Lord liveshe who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promisedAdonijah shall be put to death today!
So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada and he struck down Adonijah and he died.
To Abiathar the priest the king said Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die but I will not put you to death now because you carried the ark of the Sovereign Lord before my father David and shared all my fathers hardships.
So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the Lord fulfilling the word the Lord had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.
Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he finished building his palace and the temple of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem.
The people however were still sacrificing at the high places because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the Lord.
Solomon showed his love for the Lord by walking according to the statutes of his father David except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.
The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices for that was the most important high place and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream and God said Ask for whatever you want me to give you.
Solomon answered You have shown great kindness to your servant my father David because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day.
Now O Lord my God you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties.
Your servant is here among the people you have chosen a great people too numerous to count or number.
So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?
The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this.
So God said to him Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice
I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart so that there will never have been anyone like you nor will there ever be.
Moreover I will give you what you have not asked forboth riches and honorso that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings.
And if you walk in my ways and obey my statutes and commands as David your father did I will give you a long life.
Then Solomon awokeand he realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem stood before the ark of the Lords covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.
Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
One of them said My lord this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was there with me.
The third day after my child was born this woman also had a baby. We were alone there was no one in the house but the two of us.
During the night this womans son died because she lay on him.
So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast.
The next morning I got up to nurse my sonand he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light I saw that it wasnt the son I had borne.
The other woman said No! The living one is my son the dead one is yours. But the first one insisted No! The dead one is yours the living one is mine. And so they argued before the king.
The king said This one says My son is alive and your son is dead while that one says No! Your son is dead and mine is alive. 
Then the king said Bring me a sword. So they brought a sword for the king.
He then gave an order Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.
The woman whose son was alive was filled with compassion for her son and said to the king Please my lord give her the living baby! Dont kill him! But the other said Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!
Then the king gave his ruling Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him she is his mother.
When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given they held the king in awe because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
So King Solomon ruled over all Israel.
And these were his chief officials Azariah son of Zadokthe priest
Elihoreph and Ahijah sons of Shishasecretaries Jehoshaphat son of Ahiludrecorder
Benaiah son of Jehoiadacommander in chief Zadok and Abiatharpriests
Azariah son of Nathanin charge of the district officers Zabud son of Nathana priest and personal adviser to the king
Ahisharin charge of the palace Adoniram son of Abdain charge of forced labor.
Solomon also had twelve district governors over all Israel who supplied provisions for the king and the royal household. Each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year.
These are their names BenHurin the hill country of Ephraim
BenDekerin Makaz Shaalbim Beth Shemesh and Elon Bethhanan
BenHesedin Arubboth 
BenAbinadabin Naphoth Dor 
Baana son of Ahiludin Taanach and Megiddo and in all of Beth Shan next to Zarethan below Jezreel from Beth Shan to Abel Meholah across to Jokmeam
BenGeberin Ramoth Gilead 
Ahinadab son of Iddoin Mahanaim
Ahimaazin Naphtali 
Baana son of Hushaiin Asher and in Aloth
Jehoshaphat son of Paruahin Issachar
When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David he sent his envoys to Solomon because he had always been on friendly terms with David.
Solomon sent back this message to Hiram
You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides he could not build a temple for the Name of the Lord his God until the Lord put his enemies under his feet.
But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side and there is no adversary or disaster.
I intend therefore to build a temple for the Name of the Lord my God as the Lord told my father David when he said Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.
So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians.
When Hiram heard Solomons message he was greatly pleased and said Praise be to the Lord today for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation.
So Hiram sent word to Solomon I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and pine logs.
My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the sea and I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household.
In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and pine logs he wanted
and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household in addition to twenty thousand baths of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year.
The Lord gave Solomon wisdom just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon and the two of them made a treaty.
King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israelthirty thousand men.
He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.
Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills
as well as thirtythree hundred foremen who supervised the project and directed the workmen.
At the kings command they removed from the quarry large blocks of quality stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple.
The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and the men of Gebal cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.
In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt in the fourth year of Solomons reign over Israel in the month of Ziv the second month he began to build the temple of the Lord.
The temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits long twenty wide and thirty high.
The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple that is twenty cubits and projected ten cubits from the front of the temple.
He made narrow clerestory windows in the temple.
Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building in which there were side rooms.
The lowest floor was five cubits wide the middle floor six cubits and the third floor seven. He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.
In building the temple only blocks dressed at the quarry were used and no hammer chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.
The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the temple a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third.
So he built the temple and completed it roofing it with beams and cedar planks.
And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.
The word of the Lord came to Solomon
As for this temple you are building if you follow my decrees carry out my regulations and keep all my commands and obey them I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father.
And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel.
So Solomon built the temple and completed it.
He lined its interior walls with cedar boards paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling and covered the floor of the temple with planks of pine.
He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary the Most Holy Place.
The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.
The inside of the temple was cedar carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar no stone was to be seen.
He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord there.
The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.
Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary which was overlaid with gold.
So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
In the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim of olive wood each ten cubits high.
One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and the other wing five cubitsten cubits from wing tip to wing tip.
The second cherub also measured ten cubits for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape.
The height of each cherub was ten cubits.
He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall while the wing of the other touched the other wall and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.
He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
On the walls all around the temple in both the inner and outer rooms he carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers.
He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.
For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood with fivesided jambs.
And on the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with beaten gold.
In the same way he made foursided jambs of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall.
He also made two pine doors each having two leaves that turned in sockets.
He carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.
And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.
The foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid in the fourth year in the month of Ziv.
In the eleventh year in the month of Bul the eighth month the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.
It took Solomon thirteen years however to complete the construction of his palace.
He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long fifty wide and thirty high with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams.
It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columnsfortyfive beams fifteen to a row.
Its windows were placed high in sets of three facing each other.
All the doorways had rectangular frames they were in the front part in sets of three facing each other.
He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. In front of it was a portico and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof.
He built the throne hall the Hall of Justice where he was to judge and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.
And the palace in which he was to live set farther back was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaohs daughter whom he had married.
All these structures from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves were made of blocks of highgrade stone cut to size and trimmed with a saw on their inner and outer faces.
The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality some measuring ten cubits and some eight.
Above were highgrade stones cut to size and cedar beams.
The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the Lord with its portico.
King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram
whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was a man of Tyre and a craftsman in bronze. Huram was highly skilled and experienced in all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him.
He cast two bronze pillars each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits around by line.
He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars each capital was five cubits high.
A network of interwoven chains festooned the capitals on top of the pillars seven for each capital.
He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital.
The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies four cubits high.
On the capitals of both pillars above the bowlshaped part next to the network were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around.
He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.
The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.
He made the Sea of cast metal circular in shape measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.
Below the rim gourds encircled itten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
The Sea stood on twelve bulls three facing north three facing west three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them and their hindquarters were toward the center.
It was a handbreadth in thickness and its rim was like the rim of a cup like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.
He also made ten movable stands of bronze each was four cubits long four wide and three high.
This is how the stands were made They had side panels attached to uprights.
On the panels between the uprights were lions bulls and cherubimand on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work.
Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and each had a basin resting on four supports cast with wreaths on each side.
On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square not round.
The four wheels were under the panels and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half.
The wheels were made like chariot wheels the axles rims spokes and hubs were all of cast metal.
Each stand had four handles one on each corner projecting from the stand.
At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.
He engraved cherubim lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels in every available space with wreaths all around.
This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.
He then made ten bronze basins each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across one basin to go on each of the ten stands.
He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side at the southeast corner of the temple.
He also made the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the Lord
the two pillars the two bowlshaped capitals on top of the pillars the two sets of network decorating the two bowlshaped capitals on top of the pillars
the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network 
the ten stands with their ten basins
the Sea and the twelve bulls under it
the pots shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the Lord were of burnished bronze.
The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
Solomon left all these things unweighed because there were so many the weight of the bronze was not determined.
Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the Lords temple the golden altar the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence
the lampstands of pure gold  the gold floral work and lamps and tongs
the pure gold basins wick trimmers sprinkling bowls dishes and censers and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room the Most Holy Place and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the Lord was finished he brought in the things his father David had dedicatedthe silver and gold and the furnishingsand he placed them in the treasuries of the Lords temple.
Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families to bring up the ark of the Lords covenant from Zion the City of David.
All the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim the seventh month.
When all the elders of Israel had arrived the priests took up the ark
and they brought up the ark of the Lord and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up
and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
The priests then brought the ark of the Lords covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple the Most Holy Place and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles.
These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary but not from outside the Holy Place and they are still there today.
There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place the cloud filled the temple of the Lord.
And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord filled his temple.
Then Solomon said The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud
I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you a place for you to dwell forever.
While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there the king turned around and blessed them.
Then he said Praise be to the Lord the God of Israel who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said
Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.
My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the Lord the God of Israel.
But the Lord said to my father David Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name you did well to have this in your heart.
Nevertheless you are not the one to build the temple but your son who is your own flesh and bloodhe is the one who will build the temple for my Name.
Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel spread out his hands toward heaven
and said O Lord God of Israel there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth belowyou who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.
You have kept your promise to your servant David my father with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled itas it is today.
Now Lord God of Israel keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said You shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me as you have done.
And now O God of Israel let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true.
But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens even the highest heaven cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
When Solomon had finished building the temple of the Lord and the royal palace and had achieved all he had desired to do
the Lord appeared to him a second time as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
The Lord said to him I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me I have consecrated this temple which you have built by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
As for you if you walk before me in integrity of heart and uprightness as David your father did and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws
I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever as I promised David your father when I said You shall never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.
But if you or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them
then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
And though this temple is now imposing all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple?
People will answer Because they have forsaken the Lord their God who brought their fathers out of Egypt and have embraced other gods worshiping and serving themthat is why the Lord brought all this disaster on them. 
At the end of twenty years during which Solomon built these two buildingsthe temple of the Lord and the royal palace
King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and pine and gold he wanted.
But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him he was not pleased with them.
What kind of towns are these you have given me my brother? he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul a name they have to this day.
Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the Lords temple his own palace the supporting terraces the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor Megiddo and Gezer.
(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter Solomons wife.
And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon
Baalath and Tadmor in the desert within his land
as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.
All the people left from the Amorites Hittites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites 
that is their descendants remaining in the land whom the Israelites could not exterminate these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force as it is to this day.
But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites they were his fighting men his government officials his officers his captains and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers.
They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomons projects550 officials supervising the men who did the work.
After Pharaohs daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her he constructed the supporting terraces.
Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the Lord burning incense before the Lord along with them and so fulfilled the temple obligations.
King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber which is near Elath in Edom on the shore of the Red Sea.
And Hiram sent his mensailors who knew the seato serve in the fleet with Solomons men.
They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold which they delivered to King Solomon.
When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relation to the name of the Lord she came to test him with hard questions.
Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravanwith camels carrying spices large quantities of gold and precious stonesshe came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind.
Solomon answered all her questions nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her.
When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built
the food on his table the seating of his officials the attending servants in their robes his cupbearers and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the Lord she was overwhelmed.
She said to the king The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.
But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed not even half was told me in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard.
How happy your men must be! How happy your officials who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
Praise be to the Lord your God who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the Lords eternal love for Israel he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness.
And she gave the king 120 talents of gold large quantities of spices and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
(Hirams ships brought gold from Ophir and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood and precious stones.
The king used the almugwood to make supports for the temple of the Lord and for the royal palace and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.)
King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents
He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold with three minas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with fine gold.
The throne had six steps and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests with a lion standing beside each of them.
Twelve lions stood on the six steps one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.
All King Solomons goblets were gold and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver because silver was considered of little value in Solomons days.
The king had a fleet of trading ships at sea along with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years it returned carrying gold silver and ivory and apes and baboons.
King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.
The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
Year after year everyone who came brought a giftarticles of silver and gold robes weapons and spices and horses and mules.
Solomon accumulated chariots and horses he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones and cedar as plentiful as sycamorefig trees in the foothills.
Solomons horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.
They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.
King Solomon however loved many foreign women besides Pharaohs daughterMoabites Ammonites Edomites Sidonians and Hittites.
They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites You must not intermarry with them because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods. Nevertheless Solomon held fast to them in love.
He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines and his wives led him astray.
As Solomon grew old his wives turned his heart after other gods and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God as the heart of David his father had been.
He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.
So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord he did not follow the Lord completely as David his father had done.
On a hill east of Jerusalem Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.
He did the same for all his foreign wives who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.
The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice.
Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods Solomon did not keep the Lords command.
So the Lord said to Solomon Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees which I commanded you I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.
Nevertheless for the sake of David your father I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.
Then the Lord raised up against Solomon an adversary Hadad the Edomite from the royal line of Edom.
Earlier when David was fighting with Edom Joab the commander of the army who had gone up to bury the dead had struck down all the men in Edom.
Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.
But Hadad still only a boy fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father.
They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them they went to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.
Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife Queen Tahpenes in marriage.
The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaohs own children.
While he was in Egypt Hadad heard that David rested with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh Let me go that I may return to my own country.
What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country? Pharaoh asked. Nothing Hadad replied but do let me go!
And God raised up against Solomon another adversary Rezon son of Eliada who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah.
He gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David destroyed the forces of Zobah the rebels went to Damascus where they settled and took control.
Rezon was Israels adversary as long as Solomon lived adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.
Also Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomons officials an Ephraimite from Zeredah and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.
Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king Solomon had built the supporting terraces and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.
Now Jeroboam was a man of standing and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.
About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country
and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
Then he said to Jeroboam Take ten pieces for yourself for this is what the Lord the God of Israel says See I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomons hand and give you ten tribes.
But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel he will have one tribe.
Rehoboam went to Shechem for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.
When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this  he returned from Egypt.
So they sent for Jeroboam and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him
Your father put a heavy yoke on us but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us and we will serve you.
Rehoboam answered Go away for three days and then come back to me. So the people went away.
Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. How would you advise me to answer these people? he asked.
They replied If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants.
But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
He asked them What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me Lighten the yoke your father put on us?
The young men who had grown up with him replied Tell these people who have said to you Your father put a heavy yoke on us but make our yoke lightertell them My little finger is thicker than my fathers waist.
My father laid on you a heavy yoke I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips I will scourge you with scorpions. 
Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam as the king had said Come back to me in three days.
The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders
he followed the advice of the young men and said My father made your yoke heavy I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips I will scourge you with scorpions.
So the king did not listen to the people for this turn of events was from the Lord to fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them they answered the king What share do we have in David what part in Jesses son? To your tents O Israel! Look after your own house O David! So the Israelites went home.
But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah Rehoboam still ruled over them.
King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram who was in charge of forced labor but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam however managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem he mustered the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamina hundred and eighty thousand fighting mento make war against the house of Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.
But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God
Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people
This is what the Lord says Do not go up to fight against your brothers the Israelites. Go home every one of you for this is my doing.  So they obeyed the word of the Lord and went home again as the Lord had ordered.
Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.
Jeroboam thought to himself The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David.
If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem they will again give their allegiance to their lord Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam.
After seeking advice the king made two golden calves. He said to the people It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods O Israel who brought you up out of Egypt.
One he set up in Bethel and the other in Dan.
And this thing became a sin the people went even as far as Dan to worship the one there.
Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people even though they were not Levites.
He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the festival held in Judah and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made.
On the fifteenth day of the eighth month a month of his own choosing he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.
By the word of the Lord a man of God came from Judah to Bethel as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering.
He cried out against the altar by the word of the Lord O altar altar! This is what the Lord says A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who now make offerings here and human bones will be burned on you. 
That same day the man of God gave a sign This is the sign the Lord has declared The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out.
When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel he stretched out his hand from the altar and said Seize him! But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up so that he could not pull it back.
Also the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the Lord.
Then the king said to the man of God Intercede with the Lord your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored. So the man of God interceded with the Lord and the kings hand was restored and became as it was before.
The king said to the man of God Come home with me and have something to eat and I will give you a gift.
But the man of God answered the king Even if you were to give me half your possessions I would not go with you nor would I eat bread or drink water here.
For I was commanded by the word of the Lord You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came. 
So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king.
Their father asked them Which way did he go? And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken.
So he said to his sons Saddle the donkey for me. And when they had saddled the donkey for him he mounted it
and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked Are you the man of God who came from Judah? I am he replied.
So the prophet said to him Come home with me and eat.
The man of God said I cannot turn back and go with you nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
I have been told by the word of the Lord You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came. 
The old prophet answered I too am a prophet as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the Lord Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water. 
So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.
While they were sitting at the table the word of the Lord came to the old prophet who had brought him back.
He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah This is what the Lord says You have defied the word of the Lord and have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you.
You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers. 
When the man of God had finished eating and drinking the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him.
As he went on his way a lion met him on the road and killed him and his body was thrown down on the road with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
Some people who passed by saw the body thrown down there with the lion standing beside the body and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.
When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it he said It is the man of God who defied the word of the Lord. The Lord has given him over to the lion which has mauled him and killed him as the word of the Lord had warned him.
The prophet said to his sons Saddle the donkey for me and they did so.
Then he went out and found the body thrown down on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.
So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God laid it on the donkey and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.
Then he laid the body in his own tomb and they mourned over him and said Oh my brother!
At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill
and Jeroboam said to his wife Go disguise yourself so you wont be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is therethe one who told me I would be king over this people.
Take ten loaves of bread with you some cakes and a jar of honey and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.
So Jeroboams wife did what he said and went to Ahijahs house in Shiloh. Now Ahijah could not see his sight was gone because of his age.
But the Lord had told Ahijah Jeroboams wife is coming to ask you about her son for he is ill and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives she will pretend to be someone else.
So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door he said Come in wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news.
Go tell Jeroboam that this is what the Lord the God of Israel says I raised you up from among the people and made you a leader over my people Israel.
I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you but you have not been like my servant David who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart doing only what was right in my eyes.
You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods idols made of metal you have provoked me to anger and thrust me behind your back.
 Because of this I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israelslave or free. I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung until it is all gone.
Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country. The Lord has spoken!
As for you go back home. When you set foot in your city the boy will die.
All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the Lord the God of Israel has found anything good.
The Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Yes even now.
And the Lord will strike Israel so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their forefathers and scatter them beyond the River because they provoked the Lord to anger by making Asherah poles.
And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.
Then Jeroboams wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house the boy died.
They buried him and all Israel mourned for him as the Lord had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah.
The other events of Jeroboams reign his wars and how he ruled are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
He reigned for twentytwo years and then rested with his fathers. And Nadab his son succeeded him as king.
Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was fortyone years old when he became king and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mothers name was Naamah she was an Ammonite.
Judah did evil in the eyes of the Lord. By the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than their fathers had done.
They also set up for themselves high places sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
In the fifth year of King Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.
He carried off the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything including all the gold shields Solomon had made.
So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
Whenever the king went to the Lords temple the guards bore the shields and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.
As for the other events of Rehoboams reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. His mothers name was Naamah she was an Ammonite. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat Abijah became king of Judah
and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mothers name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
He committed all the sins his father had done before him his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God as the heart of David his forefather had been.
Nevertheless for Davids sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and by making Jerusalem strong.
For David had done what was right in the eyes of the Lord and had not failed to keep any of the Lords commands all the days of his lifeexcept in the case of Uriah the Hittite.
There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout Abijahs lifetime.
As for the other events of Abijahs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
And Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Asa his son succeeded him as king.
In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel Asa became king of Judah
and he reigned in Jerusalem fortyone years. His grandmothers name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as his father David had done.
He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made.
He even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the pole down and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
Although he did not remove the high places Asas heart was fully committed to the Lord all his life.
He brought into the temple of the Lord the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
Asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the Lords temple and of his own palace. He entrusted it to his officials and sent them to BenHadad son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion the king of Aram who was ruling in Damascus.
Let there be a treaty between me and you he said as there was between my father and your father. See I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.
BenHadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon Dan Abel Beth Maacah and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali.
When Baasha heard this he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
Then King Asa issued an order to all Judahno one was exemptand they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using there. With them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin and also Mizpah.
As for all the other events of Asas reign all his achievements all he did and the cities he built are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? In his old age however his feet became diseased.
Then Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king.
Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and he reigned over Israel two years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord walking in the ways of his father and in his sin which he had caused Israel to commit.
Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar plotted against him and he struck him down at Gibbethon a Philistine town while Nadab and all Israel were besieging it.
Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah and succeeded him as king.
As soon as he began to reign he killed Jeroboams whole family. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed but destroyed them all according to the word of the Lord given through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite
because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit and because he provoked the Lord the God of Israel to anger.
As for the other events of Nadabs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
In the third year of Asa king of Judah Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel in Tirzah and he reigned twentyfour years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in his sin which he had caused Israel to commit.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha
I lifted you up from the dust and made you leader of my people Israel but you walked in the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to provoke me to anger by their sins.
So I am about to consume Baasha and his house and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country.
As for the other events of Baashas reign what he did and his achievements are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king.
Moreover the word of the Lord came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani to Baasha and his house because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the Lord provoking him to anger by the things he did and becoming like the house of Jeroboamand also because he destroyed it.
In the twentysixth year of Asa king of Judah Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
Zimri one of his officials who had command of half his chariots plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time getting drunk in the home of Arza the man in charge of the palace at Tirzah.
Zimri came in struck him down and killed him in the twentyseventh year of Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king.
As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne he killed off Baashas whole family. He did not spare a single male whether relative or friend.
So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha in accordance with the word of the Lord spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu
because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit so that they provoked the Lord the God of Israel to anger by their worthless idols.
As for the other events of Elahs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
In the twentyseventh year of Asa king of Judah Zimri reigned in Tirzah seven days. The army was encamped near Gibbethon a Philistine town.
When the Israelites in the camp heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and murdered him they proclaimed Omri the commander of the army king over Israel that very day there in the camp.
Then Omri and all the Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah.
When Zimri saw that the city was taken he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died
because of the sins he had committed doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in the sin he had committed and had caused Israel to commit.
As for the other events of Zimris reign and the rebellion he carried out are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
Then the people of Israel were split into two factions half supported Tibni son of Ginath for king and the other half supported Omri.
But Omris followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.
In the thirtyfirst year of Asa king of Judah Omri became king of Israel and he reigned twelve years six of them in Tirzah.
Now Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe in Gilead said to Ahab As the Lord the God of Israel lives whom I serve there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.
Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah
Leave here turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine east of the Jordan.
You will drink from the brook and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there.
So he did what the Lord had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine east of the Jordan and stayed there.
The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening and he drank from the brook.
Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
Then the word of the Lord came to him
Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food.
So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?
As she was going to get it he called And bring me please a piece of bread.
As surely as the Lord your God lives she replied I dont have any breadonly a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son that we may eat itand die.
Elijah said to her Dont be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me and then make something for yourself and your son.
For this is what the Lord the God of Israel says The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land. 
She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.
For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry in keeping with the word of the Lord spoken by Elijah.
Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse and finally stopped breathing.
She said to Elijah What do you have against me man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?
Give me your son Elijah replied. He took him from her arms carried him to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his bed.
Then he cried out to the Lord O Lord my God have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with by causing her son to die?
Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the Lord O Lord my God let this boys life return to him!
The Lord heard Elijahs cry and the boys life returned to him and he lived.
Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said Look your son is alive!
Then the woman said to Elijah Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.
After a long time in the third year the word of the Lord came to Elijah Go and present yourself to Ahab and I will send rain on the land.
So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria
and Ahab had summoned Obadiah who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the Lord.
While Jezebel was killing off the Lords prophets Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves fifty in each and had supplied them with food and water.)
Ahab had said to Obadiah Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.
So they divided the land they were to cover Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another.
As Obadiah was walking along Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him bowed down to the ground and said Is it really you my lord Elijah?
Yes he replied. Go tell your master Elijah is here. 
What have I done wrong asked Obadiah that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?
As surely as the Lord your God lives there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there he made them swear they could not find you.
But now you tell me to go to my master and say Elijah is here.
I dont know where the Spirit of the Lord may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesnt find you he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the Lord since my youth.
Havent you heard my lord what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord? I hid a hundred of the Lords prophets in two caves fifty in each and supplied them with food and water.
And now you tell me to go to my master and say Elijah is here. He will kill me!
Elijah said As the Lord Almighty lives whom I serve I will surely present myself to Ahab today.
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
When he saw Elijah he said to him Is that you you troubler of Israel?
I have not made trouble for Israel Elijah replied. But you and your fathers family have. You have abandoned the Lords commands and have followed the Baals.
Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebels table.
So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say May the gods deal with me be it ever so severely if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.
Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah he left his servant there
while he himself went a days journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree sat down under it and prayed that he might die. I have had enough Lord he said. Take my life I am no better than my ancestors.
Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said Get up and eat.
He looked around and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.
The angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said Get up and eat for the journey is too much for you.
So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb the mountain of God.
There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the Lord came to him What are you doing here Elijah?
He replied I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant broken down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too.
The Lord said Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord for the Lord is about to pass by. Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
After the earthquake came a fire but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
When Elijah heard it he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him What are you doing here Elijah?
He replied I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant broken down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too.
The Lord said to him Go back the way you came and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there anoint Hazael king over Aram.
Also anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.
Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.
Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israelall whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him.
So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. Let me kiss my father and mother goodby he said and then I will come with you. Go back Elijah replied. What have I done to you?
So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.
Now BenHadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirtytwo kings with their horses and chariots he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it.
He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel saying This is what BenHadad says
Your silver and gold are mine and the best of your wives and children are mine. 
The king of Israel answered Just as you say my lord the king. I and all I have are yours.
The messengers came again and said This is what BenHadad says I sent to demand your silver and gold your wives and your children.
But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away. 
The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children my silver and my gold I did not refuse him.
The elders and the people all answered Dont listen to him or agree to his demands.
So he replied to BenHadads messengers Tell my lord the king Your servant will do all you demanded the first time but this demand I cannot meet.  They left and took the answer back to BenHadad.
Then BenHadad sent another message to Ahab May the gods deal with me be it ever so severely if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful.
The king of Israel answered Tell him One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off. 
BenHadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents and he ordered his men Prepare to attack. So they prepared to attack the city.
Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced This is what the Lord says Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today and then you will know that I am the Lord. 
But who will do this? asked Ahab. The prophet replied This is what the Lord says The young officers of the provincial commanders will do it.  And who will start the battle? he asked. The prophet answered You will.
So Ahab summoned the young officers of the provincial commanders 232 men. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites 7000 in all.
They set out at noon while BenHadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.
The young officers of the provincial commanders went out first. Now BenHadad had dispatched scouts who reported Men are advancing from Samaria.
He said If they have come out for peace take them alive if they have come out for war take them alive.
The young officers of the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them
and each one struck down his opponent. At that the Arameans fled with the Israelites in pursuit. But BenHadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen.
The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans.
Afterward the prophet came to the king of Israel and said Strengthen your position and see what must be done because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again.
Meanwhile the officials of the king of Aram advised him Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains surely we will be stronger than they.
Do this Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers.
You must also raise an army like the one you losthorse for horse and chariot for chariotso we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they. He agreed with them and acted accordingly.
The next spring BenHadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats while the Arameans covered the countryside.
The man of God came up and told the king of Israel This is what the Lord says Because the Arameans think the Lord is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys I will deliver this vast army into your hands and you will know that I am the Lord. 
Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
Ahab said to Naboth Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or if you prefer I will pay you whatever it is worth.
But Naboth replied The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.
So Ahab went home sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.
His wife Jezebel came in and asked him Why are you so sullen? Why wont you eat?
He answered her Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite Sell me your vineyard or if you prefer I will give you another vineyard in its place. But he said I will not give you my vineyard. 
Jezebel his wife said Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. Ill get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
So she wrote letters in Ahabs name placed his seal on them and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboths city with him.
In those letters she wrote Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.
So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboths city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them.
They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people saying Naboth has cursed both God and the king. So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
Then they sent word to Jezebel Naboth has been stoned and is dead.
As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death she said to Ahab Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive but dead.
When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead he got up and went down to take possession of Naboths vineyard.
Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite
Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboths vineyard where he has gone to take possession of it.
Say to him This is what the Lord says Have you not murdered a man and seized his property? Then say to him This is what the Lord says In the place where dogs licked up Naboths blood dogs will lick up your bloodyes yours! 
Ahab said to Elijah So you have found me my enemy! I have found you he answered because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord.
I am going to bring disaster on you. I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israelslave or free.
I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.
And also concerning Jezebel the Lord says Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country.
(There was never a man like Ahab who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord urged on by Jezebel his wife.
He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols like the Amorites the Lord drove out before Israel.)
When Ahab heard these words he tore his clothes put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.
Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite
Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself I will not bring this disaster in his day but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son.
For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.
But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.
The king of Israel had said to his officials Dont you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?
So he asked Jehoshaphat Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead? Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses.
But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel First seek the counsel of the Lord.
So the king of Israel brought together the prophetsabout four hundred menand asked them Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead or shall I refrain? Go they answered for the Lord will give it into the kings hand.
But Jehoshaphat asked Is there not a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?
The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the Lord but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah. The king should not say that Jehoshaphat replied.
So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.
Dressed in their royal robes the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria with all the prophets prophesying before them.
Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared This is what the Lord says With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed. 
All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious they said for the Lord will give it into the kings hand.
The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him Look as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs and speak favorably.
But Micaiah said As surely as the Lord lives I can tell him only what the Lord tells me.
When he arrived the king asked him Micaiah shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead or shall I refrain? Attack and be victorious he answered for the Lord will give it into the kings hand.
The king said to him How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?
Then Micaiah answered I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd and the Lord said These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace. 
After Ahabs death Moab rebelled against Israel.
Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers saying to them Go and consult BaalZebub the god of Ekron to see if I will recover from this injury.
But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult BaalZebub the god of Ekron?
Therefore this is what the Lord says You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!  So Elijah went.
When the messengers returned to the king he asked them Why have you come back?
A man came to meet us they replied. And he said to us Go back to the king who sent you and tell him This is what the Lord says Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult BaalZebub the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!  
The king asked them What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?
They replied He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist. The king said That was Elijah the Tishbite.
Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah who was sitting on the top of a hill and said to him Man of God the king says Come down! 
Elijah answered the captain If I am a man of God may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men! Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.
At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him Man of God this is what the king says Come down at once! 
If I am a man of God Elijah replied may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men! Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.
So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. Man of God he begged please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men your servants!
See fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!
The angel of the Lord said to Elijah Go down with him do not be afraid of him. So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.
He told the king This is what the Lord says Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult BaalZebub the god of Ekron? Because you have done this you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!
So he died according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.
As for all the other events of Ahaziahs reign and what he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
Elijah said to Elisha Stay here the Lord has sent me to Bethel. But Elisha said As surely as the Lord lives and as you live I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.
The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today? Yes I know Elisha replied but do not speak of it.
Then Elijah said to him Stay here Elisha the Lord has sent me to Jericho. And he replied As surely as the Lord lives and as you live I will not leave you. So they went to Jericho.
The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today? Yes I know he replied but do not speak of it.
Then Elijah said to him Stay here the Lord has sent me to the Jordan. And he replied As surely as the Lord lives and as you live I will not leave you. So the two of them walked on.
Fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.
Elijah took his cloak rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
When they had crossed Elijah said to Elisha Tell me what can I do for you before I am taken from you? Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit Elisha replied.
You have asked a difficult thing Elijah said yet if you see me when I am taken from you it will be yoursotherwise not.
As they were walking along and talking together suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
Elisha saw this and cried out My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel! And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart.
He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. Where now is the Lord the God of Elijah? he asked. When he struck the water it divided to the right and to the left and he crossed over.
The company of the prophets from Jericho who were watching said The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha. And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
Look they said we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley. No Elisha replied do not send them.
But they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse. So he said Send them. And they sent fifty men who searched for three days but did not find him.
When they returned to Elisha who was staying in Jericho he said to them Didnt I tell you not to go?
The men of the city said to Elisha Look our lord this town is well situated as you can see but the water is bad and the land is unproductive.
Bring me a new bowl he said and put salt in it. So they brought it to him.
Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it saying This is what the Lord says I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive. 
And the water has remained wholesome to this day according to the word Elisha had spoken.
From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. Go on up you baldhead! they said. Go on up you baldhead!
He turned around looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled fortytwo of the youths.
And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.
Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and he reigned twelve years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.
Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which he had caused Israel to commit he did not turn away from them.
Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep and he had to supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
But after Ahab died the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab? I will go with you he replied. I am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses.
By what route shall we attack? he asked. Through the Desert of Edom he answered.
So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.
What! exclaimed the king of Israel. Has the Lord called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?
But Jehoshaphat asked Is there no prophet of the Lord here that we may inquire of the Lord through him? An officer of the king of Israel answered Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.
Jehoshaphat said The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
Elisha said to the king of Israel What do we have to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother. No the king of Israel answered because it was the Lord who called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab.
Elisha said As surely as the Lord Almighty lives whom I serve if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I would not look at you or even notice you.
But now bring me a harpist. While the harpist was playing the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha
and he said This is what the Lord says Make this valley full of ditches.
For this is what the Lord says You will see neither wind nor rain yet this valley will be filled with water and you your cattle and your other animals will drink.
This is an easy thing in the eyes of the Lord he will also hand Moab over to you.
You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree stop up all the springs and ruin every good field with stones.
The next morning about the time for offering the sacrifice there it waswater flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.
Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them so every man young and old who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border.
When they got up early in the morning the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way the water looked redlike blood.
Thats blood! they said. Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder Moab!
But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.
They destroyed the towns and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.
When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom but they failed.
Then he took his firstborn son who was to succeed him as king and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great they withdrew and returned to their own land.
The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha Your servant my husband is dead and you know that he revered the Lord. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves.
Elisha replied to her How can I help you? Tell me what do you have in your house? Your servant has nothing there at all she said except a little oil.
Elisha said Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Dont ask for just a few.
Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars and as each is filled put it to one side.
She left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.
When all the jars were full she said to her son Bring me another one. But he replied There is not a jar left. Then the oil stopped flowing.
She went and told the man of God and he said Go sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left.
One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a welltodo woman was there who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by he stopped there to eat.
She said to her husband I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.
Lets make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us.
One day when Elisha came he went up to his room and lay down there.
He said to his servant Gehazi Call the Shunammite. So he called her and she stood before him.
Elisha said to him Tell her You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?  She replied I have a home among my own people.
What can be done for her? Elisha asked. Gehazi said Well she has no son and her husband is old.
Then Elisha said Call her. So he called her and she stood in the doorway.
About this time next year Elisha said you will hold a son in your arms. No my lord she objected. Dont mislead your servant O man of God!
But the woman became pregnant and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son just as Elisha had told her.
The child grew and one day he went out to his father who was with the reapers.
My head! My head! he said to his father. His father told a servant Carry him to his mother.
After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother the boy sat on her lap until noon and then he died.
She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God then shut the door and went out.
She called her husband and said Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return.
Why go to him today? he asked. Its not the New Moon or the Sabbath. Its all right she said.
She saddled the donkey and said to her servant Lead on dont slow down for me unless I tell you.
So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance the man of God said to his servant Gehazi Look! Theres the Shunammite!
Run to meet her and ask her Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?  Everything is all right she said.
Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded because through him the Lord had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier but he had leprosy.
Now bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel and she served Naamans wife.
She said to her mistress If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.
Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.
By all means go the king of Aram replied. I will send a letter to the king of Israel. So Naaman left taking with him ten talents of silver six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing.
The letter that he took to the king of Israel read With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy.
As soon as the king of Israel read the letter he tore his robes and said Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!
When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes he sent him this message Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.
So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elishas house.
Elisha sent a messenger to say to him Go wash yourself seven times in the Jordan and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed.
But Naaman went away angry and said I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy.
Are not Abana and Pharpar the rivers of Damascus better than any of the waters of Israel? Couldnt I wash in them and be cleansed? So he turned and went off in a rage.
Naamans servants went to him and said My father if the prophet had told you to do some great thing would you not have done it? How much more then when he tells you Wash and be cleansed!
So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times as the man of God had told him and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy.
Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. Please accept now a gift from your servant.
The prophet answered As surely as the Lord lives whom I serve I will not accept a thing. And even though Naaman urged him he refused.
If you will not said Naaman please let me your servant be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the Lord.
But may the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I bow there alsowhen I bow down in the temple of Rimmon may the Lord forgive your servant for this.
Go in peace Elisha said. After Naaman had traveled some distance
Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said to himself My master was too easy on Naaman this Aramean by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the Lord lives I will run after him and get something from him.
So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him he got down from the chariot to meet him. Is everything all right? he asked.
Everything is all right Gehazi answered. My master sent me to say Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing. 
By all means take two talents said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.
When Gehazi came to the hill he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.
Then he went in and stood before his master Elisha. Where have you been Gehazi? Elisha asked. Your servant didnt go anywhere Gehazi answered.
But Elisha said to him Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes olive groves vineyards flocks herds or menservants and maidservants?
Naamans leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever. Then Gehazi went from Elishas presence and he was leprous as white as snow.
The company of the prophets said to Elisha Look the place where we meet with you is too small for us.
Let us go to the Jordan where each of us can get a pole and let us build a place there for us to live. And he said Go.
Then one of them said Wont you please come with your servants? I will Elisha replied.
And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.
As one of them was cutting down a tree the iron axhead fell into the water. Oh my lord he cried out it was borrowed!
The man of God asked Where did it fall? When he showed him the place Elisha cut a stick and threw it there and made the iron float.
Lift it out he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.
Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers he said I will set up my camp in such and such a place.
The man of God sent word to the king of Israel Beware of passing that place because the Arameans are going down there.
So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king so that he was on his guard in such places.
This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them Will you not tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?
None of us my lord the king said one of his officers but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.
Go find out where he is the king ordered so I can send men and capture him. The report came back He is in Dothan.
Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city.
When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. Oh my lord what shall we do? the servant asked.
Dont be afraid the prophet answered. Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
And Elisha prayed O Lord open his eyes so he may see. Then the Lord opened the servants eyes and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
As the enemy came down toward him Elisha prayed to the Lord Strike these people with blindness. So he struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.
Elisha told them This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me and I will lead you to the man you are looking for. And he led them to Samaria.
Elisha said Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord says About this time tomorrow a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.
The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God Look even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens could this happen? You will see it with your own eyes answered Elisha but you will not eat any of it!
Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other Why stay here until we die?
If we say Well go into the citythe famine is there and we will die. And if we stay here we will die. So lets go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us we live if they kill us then we die.
At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp not a man was there
for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army so that they said to one another Look the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!
So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.
The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp and entered one of the tents. They ate and drank and carried away silver gold and clothes and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.
Then they said to each other Were not doing right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight punishment will overtake us. Lets go at once and report this to the royal palace.
So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them We went into the Aramean camp and not a man was therenot a sound of anyoneonly tethered horses and donkeys and the tents left just as they were.
The gatekeepers shouted the news and it was reported within the palace.
The king got up in the night and said to his officers I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside thinking They will surely come out and then we will take them alive and get into the city. 
One of his officers answered Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left hereyes they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.
So they selected two chariots with their horses and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers Go and find out what has happened.
They followed them as far as the Jordan and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.
Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of flour sold for a shekel and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel as the Lord had said.
Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate and the people trampled him in the gateway and he died just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.
It happened as the man of God had said to the king About this time tomorrow a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.
The officer had said to the man of God Look even if the Lord should open the floodgates of the heavens could this happen? The man of God had replied You will see it with your own eyes but you will not eat any of it!
And that is exactly what happened to him for the people trampled him in the gateway and he died.
Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can because the Lord has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years.
The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.
At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king to beg for her house and land.
The king was talking to Gehazi the servant of the man of God and had said Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.
Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to beg the king for her house and land. Gehazi said This is the woman my lord the king and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.
The king asked the woman about it and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him Give back everything that belonged to her including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.
Elisha went to Damascus and BenHadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told The man of God has come all the way up here
he said to Hazael Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the Lord through him ask him Will I recover from this illness? 
Hazael went to meet Elisha taking with him as a gift forty camelloads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him and said Your son BenHadad king of Aram has sent me to ask Will I recover from this illness? 
Elisha answered Go and say to him You will certainly recover but the Lord has revealed to me that he will in fact die.
He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael felt ashamed. Then the man of God began to weep.
Why is my lord weeping? asked Hazael. Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites he answered. You will set fire to their fortified places kill their young men with the sword dash their little children to the ground and rip open their pregnant women.
Hazael said How could your servant a mere dog accomplish such a feat? The Lord has shown me that you will become king of Aram answered Elisha.
In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah.
He was thirtytwo years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
Nevertheless for the sake of his servant David the Lord was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.
In the time of Jehoram Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.
So Jehoram went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders but he rose up and broke through by night his army however fled back home.
To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time.
As for the other events of Jehorams reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
Ahaziah was twentytwo years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mothers name was Athaliah a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the Lord as the house of Ahab had done for he was related by marriage to Ahabs family.
Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram
so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.
The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him Tuck your cloak into your belt take this flask of oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead.
When you get there look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi. Go to him get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room.
Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare This is what the Lord says I anoint you king over Israel. Then open the door and run dont delay!
So the young man the prophet went to Ramoth Gilead.
When he arrived he found the army officers sitting together. I have a message for you commander he said. For which of us? asked Jehu. For you commander he replied.
Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehus head and declared This is what the Lord the God of Israel says I anoint you king over the Lords people Israel.
You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Lords servants shed by Jezebel.
The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israelslave or free.
I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
As for Jezebel dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel and no one will bury her.  Then he opened the door and ran.
When Jehu went out to his fellow officers one of them asked him Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you? You know the man and the sort of things he says Jehu replied.
Thats not true! they said. Tell us. Jehu said Here is what he told me This is what the Lord says I anoint you king over Israel. 
They hurried and took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted Jehu is king!
So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram
but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said If this is the way you feel dont let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.
Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehus troops approaching he called out I see some troops coming. Get a horseman Joram ordered. Send him to meet them and ask Do you come in peace? 
The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said This is what the king says Do you come in peace?  What do you have to do with peace? Jehu replied. Fall in behind me. The lookout reported The messenger has reached them but he isnt coming back.
So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said This is what the king says Do you come in peace?  Jehu replied What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.
The lookout reported He has reached them but he isnt coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshihe drives like a madman.
Hitch up my chariot Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out each in his own chariot to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.
When Joram saw Jehu he asked Have you come in peace Jehu? How can there be peace Jehu replied as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?
Joram turned about and fled calling out to Ahaziah Treachery Ahaziah!
Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot.
Jehu said to Bidkar his chariot officer Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the Lord made this prophecy about him
Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons declares the Lord and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground declares the Lord. Now then pick him up and throw him on that plot in accordance with the word of the Lord.
When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him shouting Kill him too! They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.
His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.

Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it she painted her eyes arranged her hair and looked out of a window.
As Jehu entered the gate she asked Have you come in peace Zimri you murderer of your master?
He looked up at the window and called out Who is on my side? Who? Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
Throw her down! Jehu said. So they threw her down and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
Jehu went in and ate and drank. Take care of that cursed woman he said and bury her for she was a kings daughter.
But when they went out to bury her they found nothing except her skull her feet and her hands.
Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel to the elders and to the guardians of Ahabs children. He said
As soon as this letter reaches you since your masters sons are with you and you have chariots and horses a fortified city and weapons
choose the best and most worthy of your masters sons and set him on his fathers throne. Then fight for your masters house.
But they were terrified and said If two kings could not resist him how can we?
So the palace administrator the city governor the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king you do whatever you think best.
Then Jehu wrote them a second letter saying If you are on my side and will obey me take the heads of your masters sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the royal princes seventy of them were with the leading men of the city who were rearing them.
When the letter arrived these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
When the messenger arrived he told Jehu They have brought the heads of the princes. Then Jehu ordered Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.
The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him but who killed all these?
Know then that not a word the Lord has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The Lord has done what he promised through his servant Elijah.
So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab as well as all his chief men his close friends and his priests leaving him no survivor.
Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds
he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked Who are you? They said We are relatives of Ahaziah and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother.
Take them alive! he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Ekedfortytwo men. He left no survivor.
After he left there he came upon Jehonadab son of Recab who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said Are you in accord with me as I am with you? I am Jehonadab answered. If so said Jehu give me your hand. So he did and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.
Jehu said Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord. Then he had him ride along in his chariot.
When Jehu came to Samaria he killed all who were left there of Ahabs family he destroyed them according to the word of the Lord spoken to Elijah.
Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them Ahab served Baal a little Jehu will serve him much.
Now summon all the prophets of Baal all his ministers and all his priests. See that no one is missing because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live. But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the ministers of Baal.
Jehu said Call an assembly in honor of Baal. So they proclaimed it.
When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family.
But Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah so he was not killed.
He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the Lord for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the Lord. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath at the temple of the Lord. Then he showed them the kings son.
He commanded them saying This is what you are to do You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbatha third of you guarding the royal palace
a third at the Sur Gate and a third at the gate behind the guard who take turns guarding the temple
and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king.
Station yourselves around the king each man with his weapon in his hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.
The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his menthose who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off dutyand came to Jehoiada the priest.
Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the Lord.
The guards each with his weapon in his hand stationed themselves around the kingnear the altar and the temple from the south side to the north side of the temple.
Jehoiada brought out the kings son and put the crown on him he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and the people clapped their hands and shouted Long live the king!
When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people she went to the people at the temple of the Lord.
She looked and there was the king standing by the pillar as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out Treason! Treason!
Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred who were in charge of the troops Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her. For the priest had said She must not be put to death in the temple of the Lord.
So they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds and there she was put to death.
Jehoiada then made a covenant between the Lord and the king and people that they would be the Lords people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.
All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the Lord.
He took with him the commanders of hundreds the Carites the guards and all the people of the land and together they brought the king down from the temple of the Lord and went into the palace entering by way of the gate of the guards. The king then took his place on the royal throne
and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet because Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace.
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.
In the seventh year of Jehu Joash became king and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mothers name was Zibiah she was from Beersheba.
Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the years Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
The high places however were not removed the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
Joash said to the priests Collect all the money that is brought as sacred offerings to the temple of the Lordthe money collected in the census the money received from personal vows and the money brought voluntarily to the temple.
Let every priest receive the money from one of the treasurers and let it be used to repair whatever damage is found in the temple.
But by the twentythird year of King Joash the priests still had not repaired the temple.
Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them Why arent you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers but hand it over for repairing the temple.
The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves.
Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar on the right side as one enters the temple of the Lord. The priests who guarded the entrance put into the chest all the money that was brought to the temple of the Lord.
Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest the royal secretary and the high priest came counted the money that had been brought into the temple of the Lord and put it into bags.
When the amount had been determined they gave the money to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. With it they paid those who worked on the temple of the Lordthe carpenters and builders
the masons and stonecutters. They purchased timber and dressed stone for the repair of the temple of the Lord and met all the other expenses of restoring the temple.
The money brought into the temple was not spent for making silver basins wick trimmers sprinkling bowls trumpets or any other articles of gold or silver for the temple of the Lord
it was paid to the workmen who used it to repair the temple.
They did not require an accounting from those to whom they gave the money to pay the workers because they acted with complete honesty.
The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the Lord it belonged to the priests.
About this time Hazael king of Aram went up and attacked Gath and captured it. Then he turned to attack Jerusalem.
But Joash king of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his fathersJehoshaphat Jehoram and Ahaziah the kings of Judahand the gifts he himself had dedicated and all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the Lord and of the royal palace and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram who then withdrew from Jerusalem.
As for the other events of the reign of Joash and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
His officials conspired against him and assassinated him at Beth Millo on the road down to Silla.
The officials who murdered him were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. He died and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
In the twentythird year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria and he reigned seventeen years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord by following the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which he had caused Israel to commit and he did not turn away from them.
So the Lords anger burned against Israel and for a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael king of Aram and BenHadad his son.
Then Jehoahaz sought the Lords favor and the Lord listened to him for he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel.
The Lord provided a deliverer for Israel and they escaped from the power of Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had before.
But they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam which he had caused Israel to commit they continued in them. Also the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria.
Nothing had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers for the king of Aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time.
As for the other events of the reign of Jehoahaz all he did and his achievements are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoash his son succeeded him as king.
In the thirtyseventh year of Joash king of Judah Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria and he reigned sixteen years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which he had caused Israel to commit he continued in them.
As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash all he did and his achievements including his war against Amaziah king of Judah are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
Jehoash rested with his fathers and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
Now Elisha was suffering from the illness from which he died. Jehoash king of Israel went down to see him and wept over him. My father! My father! he cried. The chariots and horsemen of Israel!
Elisha said Get a bow and some arrows and he did so.
Take the bow in your hands he said to the king of Israel. When he had taken it Elisha put his hands on the kings hands.
Open the east window he said and he opened it. Shoot! Elisha said and he shot. The Lords arrow of victory the arrow of victory over Aram! Elisha declared. You will completely destroy the Arameans at Aphek.
Then he said Take the arrows and the king took them. Elisha told him Strike the ground. He struck it three times and stopped.
The man of God was angry with him and said You should have struck the ground five or six times then you would have defeated Aram and completely destroyed it. But now you will defeat it only three times.
Elisha died and was buried. Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring.
Once while some Israelites were burying a man suddenly they saw a band of raiders so they threw the mans body into Elishas tomb. When the body touched Elishas bones the man came to life and stood up on his feet.
Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
But the Lord was gracious to them and had compassion and showed concern for them because of his covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob. To this day he has been unwilling to destroy them or banish them from his presence.
Hazael king of Aram died and BenHadad his son succeeded him as king.
Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from BenHadad son of Hazael the towns he had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Three times Jehoash defeated him and so he recovered the Israelite towns.
In the second year of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah began to reign.
He was twentyfive years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem twentynine years. His mothers name was Jehoaddin she was from Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but not as his father David had done. In everything he followed the example of his father Joash.
The high places however were not removed the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
After the kingdom was firmly in his grasp he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.
Yet he did not put the sons of the assassins to death in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses where the Lord commanded Fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children put to death for their fathers each is to die for his own sins.
He was the one who defeated ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela in battle calling it Joktheel the name it has to this day.
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel with the challenge Come meet me face to face.
But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon Give your daughter to my son in marriage. Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
You have indeed defeated Edom and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory but stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?
Amaziah however would not listen so Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
Judah was routed by Israel and every man fled to his home.
Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah the son of Joash the son of Ahaziah at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gatea section about six hundred feet long.
He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace. He also took hostages and returned to Samaria.
As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash what he did and his achievements including his war against Amaziah king of Judah are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
Jehoash rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son succeeded him as king.
Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
As for the other events of Amaziahs reign are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
They conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
He was brought back by horse and was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.
Then all the people of Judah took Azariah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his fathers.
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel became king in Samaria and he reigned fortyone years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which he had caused Israel to commit.
He was the one who restored the boundaries of Israel from Lebo Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah in accordance with the word of the Lord the God of Israel spoken through his servant Jonah son of Amittai the prophet from Gath Hepher.
The Lord had seen how bitterly everyone in Israel whether slave or free was suffering there was no one to help them.
And since the Lord had not said he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
As for the other events of Jeroboams reign all he did and his military achievements including how he recovered for Israel both Damascus and Hamath which had belonged to Yaudi are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
Jeroboam rested with his fathers the kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son succeeded him as king.
In the twentyseventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign.
He was sixteen years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem fiftytwo years. His mothers name was Jecoliah she was from Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord just as his father Amaziah had done.
The high places however were not removed the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
The Lord afflicted the king with leprosy until the day he died and he lived in a separate house. Jotham the kings son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
As for the other events of Azariahs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
Azariah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in the City of David. And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
In the thirtyeighth year of Azariah king of Judah Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in Samaria and he reigned six months.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which he had caused Israel to commit.
Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah. He attacked him in front of the people assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
The other events of Zechariahs reign are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
So the word of the Lord spoken to Jehu was fulfilled Your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.
Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirtyninth year of Uzziah king of Judah and he reigned in Samaria one month.
Then Menahem son of Gadi went from Tirzah up to Samaria. He attacked Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
The other events of Shallums reign and the conspiracy he led are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
At that time Menahem starting out from Tirzah attacked Tiphsah and everyone in the city and its vicinity because they refused to open their gates. He sacked Tiphsah and ripped open all the pregnant women.
In the thirtyninth year of Azariah king of Judah Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel and he reigned in Samaria ten years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord. During his entire reign he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which he had caused Israel to commit.
Then Pul king of Assyria invaded the land and Menahem gave him a thousand talents of silver to gain his support and strengthen his own hold on the kingdom.
In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah Ahaz son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire following the detestable ways of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem and besieged Ahaz but they could not overpower him.
At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram by driving out the men of Judah. Edomites then moved into Elath and have lived there to this day.
Ahaz sent messengers to say to TiglathPileser king of Assyria I am your servant and vassal. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram and of the king of Israel who are attacking me.
And Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
The king of Assyria complied by attacking Damascus and capturing it. He deported its inhabitants to Kir and put Rezin to death.
Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet TiglathPileser king of Assyria. He saw an altar in Damascus and sent to Uriah the priest a sketch of the altar with detailed plans for its construction.
So Uriah the priest built an altar in accordance with all the plans that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus and finished it before King Ahaz returned.
When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar he approached it and presented offerings on it.
He offered up his burnt offering and grain offering poured out his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar.
The bronze altar that stood before the Lord he brought from the front of the templefrom between the new altar and the temple of the Lordand put it on the north side of the new altar.
King Ahaz then gave these orders to Uriah the priest On the large new altar offer the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering the kings burnt offering and his grain offering and the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their grain offering and their drink offering. Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar for seeking guidance.
And Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had ordered.
King Ahaz took away the side panels and removed the basins from the movable stands. He removed the Sea from the bronze bulls that supported it and set it on a stone base.
He took away the Sabbath canopy that had been built at the temple and removed the royal entryway outside the temple of the Lord in deference to the king of Assyria.
As for the other events of the reign of Ahaz and what he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria and he reigned nine years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him.
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up to attack Hoshea who had been Shalmanesers vassal and had paid him tribute.
But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor for he had sent envoys to So king of Egypt and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison.
The king of Assyria invaded the entire land marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years.
In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.
All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods
and followed the practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before them as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced.
The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns.
They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
At every high place they burned incense as the nations whom the Lord had driven out before them had done. They did wicked things that provoked the Lord to anger.
They worshiped idols though the Lord had said You shall not do this.
The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers Turn from your evil ways. Observe my commands and decrees in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your fathers to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets.
But they would not listen and were as stiffnecked as their fathers who did not trust in the Lord their God.
They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their fathers and the warnings he had given them. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the Lord had ordered them Do not do as they do and they did the things the Lord had forbidden them to do.
They forsook all the commands of the Lord their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the starry hosts and they worshiped Baal.
They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sorcery and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the Lord provoking him to anger.
So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left
and even Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God. They followed the practices Israel had introduced.
Therefore the Lord rejected all the people of Israel he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers until he thrust them from his presence.
When he tore Israel away from the house of David they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.
The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them
until the Lord removed them from his presence as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria and they are still there.
The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon Cuthah Avva Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns.
When they first lived there they did not worship the Lord so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people.
It was reported to the king of Assyria The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires. He has sent lions among them which are killing them off because the people do not know what he requires.
Then the king of Assyria gave this order Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires.
So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the Lord.
Nevertheless each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places.
The men from Babylon made Succoth Benoth the men from Cuthah made Nergal and the men from Hamath made Ashima
the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
They worshiped the Lord but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places.
They worshiped the Lord but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.
To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the Lord nor adhere to the decrees and ordinances the laws and commands that the Lord gave the descendants of Jacob whom he named Israel.
When the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites he commanded them Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them serve them or sacrifice to them.
But the Lord who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices.
In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
He was twentyfive years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem twentynine years. His mothers name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord just as his father David had done.
He removed the high places smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it.
Hezekiah trusted in the Lord the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah either before him or after him.
He held fast to the Lord and did not cease to follow him he kept the commands the Lord had given Moses.
And the Lord was with him he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
From watchtower to fortified city he defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory.
In King Hezekiahs fourth year which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and laid siege to it.
At the end of three years the Assyrians took it. So Samaria was captured in Hezekiahs sixth year which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah in Gozan on the Habor River and in towns of the Medes.
This happened because they had not obeyed the Lord their God but had violated his covenantall that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded. They neither listened to the commands nor carried them out.
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiahs reign Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish I have done wrong. Withdraw from me and I will pay whatever you demand of me. The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the Lord and gave it to the king of Assyria.
The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander his chief officer and his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool on the road to the Washermans Field.
They called for the king and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them.
The field commander said to them Tell Hezekiah  This is what the great king the king of Assyria says On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
You say you have strategy and military strengthbut you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending that you rebel against me?
Look now you are depending on Egypt that splintered reed of a staff which pierces a mans hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
And if you say to me We are depending on the Lord our Godisnt he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed saying to Judah and Jerusalem You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
 Come now make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria I will give you two thousand horsesif you can put riders on them!
How can you repulse one officer of the least of my masters officials even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
Furthermore have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the Lord? The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it. 
Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander Please speak to your servants in Aramaic since we understand it. Dont speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.
But the commander replied Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things and not to the men sitting on the wallwho like you will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?
Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew Hear the word of the great king the king of Assyria!
This is what the king says Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand.
Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says The Lord will surely deliver us this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern
until I come and take you to a land like your own a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death! Do not listen to Hezekiah for he is misleading you when he says The Lord will deliver us.
Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand?
But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply because the king had commanded Do not answer him.
Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what the field commander had said.
When King Hezekiah heard this he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord.
He sent Eliakim the palace administrator Shebna the secretary and the leading priests all wearing sackcloth to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
They told him This is what Hezekiah says This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of the field commander whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to ridicule the living God and that he will rebuke him for the words the Lord your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.
When King Hezekiahs officials came to Isaiah
Isaiah said to them Tell your master This is what the Lord says Do not be afraid of what you have heardthose words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
Listen! I am going to put such a spirit in him that when he hears a certain report he will return to his own country and there I will have him cut down with the sword. 
When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah the Cushite king of Egypt was marching out to fight against him. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word
Say to Hezekiah king of Judah Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.
Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them the gods of Gozan Haran Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
Where is the king of Hamath the king of Arpad the king of the city of Sepharvaim or of Hena or Ivvah?
Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.
And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord O Lord God of Israel enthroned between the cherubim you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
Give ear O Lord and hear open your eyes O Lord and see listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
It is true O Lord that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands.
They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them for they were not gods but only wood and stone fashioned by mens hands.
Now O Lord our God deliver us from his hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone O Lord are God.
Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah This is what the Lord the God of Israel says I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said This is what the Lord says Put your house in order because you are going to die you will not recover.
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord
Remember O Lord how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
Before Isaiah had left the middle court the word of the Lord came to him
Go back and tell Hezekiah the leader of my people This is what the Lord the God of your father David says I have heard your prayer and seen your tears I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the Lord.
I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David. 
Then Isaiah said Prepare a poultice of figs. They did so and applied it to the boil and he recovered.
Hezekiah had asked Isaiah What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the Lord on the third day from now?
Isaiah answered This is the Lords sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised Shall the shadow go forward ten steps or shall it go back ten steps?
It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps said Hezekiah. Rather have it go back ten steps.
Then the prophet Isaiah called upon the Lord and the Lord made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
At that time MerodachBaladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift because he had heard of Hezekiahs illness.
Hezekiah received the messengers and showed them all that was in his storehousesthe silver the gold the spices and the fine oilhis armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked What did those men say and where did they come from? From a distant land Hezekiah replied. They came from Babylon.
The prophet asked What did they see in your palace? They saw everything in my palace Hezekiah said. There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah Hear the word of the Lord
The time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left says the Lord.
And some of your descendants your own flesh and blood that will be born to you will be taken away and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
The word of the Lord you have spoken is good Hezekiah replied. For he thought Will there not be peace and security in my lifetime?
As for the other events of Hezekiahs reign all his achievements and how he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
Hezekiah rested with his fathers. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem fiftyfive years. His mothers name was Hephzibah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord following the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole as Ahab king of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.
He built altars in the temple of the Lord of which the Lord had said In Jerusalem I will put my Name.
In both courts of the temple of the Lord he built altars to all the starry hosts.
He sacrificed his own son in the fire practiced sorcery and divination and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord provoking him to anger.
He took the carved Asherah pole he had made and put it in the temple of which the Lord had said to David and to his son Solomon In this temple and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel I will put my Name forever.
I will not again make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their forefathers if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them and will keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them.
But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray so that they did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites.
The Lord said through his servants the prophets
Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins. He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols.
Therefore this is what the Lord the God of Israel says I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish wiping it and turning it upside down.
I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and hand them over to their enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their foes
because they have done evil in my eyes and have provoked me to anger from the day their forefathers came out of Egypt until this day.
Moreover Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to endbesides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit so that they did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
As for the other events of Manassehs reign and all he did including the sin he committed are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace garden the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
Amon was twentytwo years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mothers name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz she was from Jotbah.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem thirtyone years. His mothers name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah she was from Bozkath.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and walked in all the ways of his father David not turning aside to the right or to the left.
In the eighteenth year of his reign King Josiah sent the secretary Shaphan son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam to the temple of the Lord. He said
Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the Lord which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.
Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the Lord
the carpenters the builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple.
But they need not account for the money entrusted to them because they are acting faithfully.
Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord. He gave it to Shaphan who read it.
Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.
Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law he tore his robes.
He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest Ahikam son of Shaphan Acbor son of Micaiah Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the kings attendant
Go and inquire of the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the Lords anger that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us.
Hilkiah the priest Ahikam Acbor Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophetess Huldah who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah the son of Harhas keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second District.
She said to them This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Tell the man who sent you to me
This is what the Lord says I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people according to everything written in the book the king of Judah has read.
Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all the idols their hands have made my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.
Tell the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord This is what the Lord the God of Israel says concerning the words you heard
Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people that they would become accursed and laid waste and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence I have heard you declares the Lord.
Therefore I will gather you to your fathers and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.  So they took her answer back to the king.
Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
He went up to the temple of the Lord with the men of Judah the people of Jerusalem the priests and the prophetsall the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the temple of the Lord.
The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lordto follow the Lord and keep his commands regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.
The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the Lord all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel.
He did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalemthose who burned incense to Baal to the sun and moon to the constellations and to all the starry hosts.
He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.
He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes which were in the temple of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah.
Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places from Geba to Beersheba where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the shrines at the gatesat the entrance to the Gate of Joshua the city governor which is on the left of the city gate.
Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.
He desecrated Topheth which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom so no one could use it to sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to Molech.
He removed from the entrance to the temple of the Lord the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the room of an official named NathanMelech. Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun.
He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the Lord. He removed them from there smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley.
The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruptionthe ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians for Chemosh the vile god of Moab and for Molech the detestable god of the people of Ammon.
Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones.
Even the altar at Bethel the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat who had caused Israel to sineven that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder and burned the Asherah pole also.
Then Josiah looked around and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it in accordance with the word of the Lord proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things.
The king asked What is that tombstone I see? The men of the city said It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.
Leave it alone he said. Dont let anyone disturb his bones. So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
Just as he had done at Bethel Josiah removed and defiled all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria that had provoked the Lord to anger.
During Jehoiakims reign Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But then he changed his mind and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.
The Lord sent Babylonian Aramean Moabite and Ammonite raiders against him. He sent them to destroy Judah in accordance with the word of the Lord proclaimed by his servants the prophets.
Surely these things happened to Judah according to the Lords command in order to remove them from his presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all he had done
including the shedding of innocent blood. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood and the Lord was not willing to forgive.
As for the other events of Jehoiakims reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
The king of Egypt did not march out from his own country again because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mothers name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan she was from Jerusalem.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord just as his father had done.
At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege to it
and Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city while his officers were besieging it.
Jehoiachin king of Judah his mother his attendants his nobles and his officials all surrendered to him. In the eighth year of the reign of the king of Babylon he took Jehoiachin prisoner.
As the Lord had declared Nebuchadnezzar removed all the treasures from the temple of the Lord and from the royal palace and took away all the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple of the Lord.
He carried into exile all Jerusalem all the officers and fighting men and all the craftsmen and artisansa total of ten thousand. Only the poorest people of the land were left.
Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. He also took from Jerusalem to Babylon the kings mother his wives his officials and the leading men of the land.
The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon the entire force of seven thousand fighting men strong and fit for war and a thousand craftsmen and artisans.
He made Mattaniah Jehoiachins uncle king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.
Zedekiah was twentyone years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mothers name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah she was from Libnah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord just as Jehoiakim had done.
It was because of the Lords anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
So in the ninth year of Zedekiahs reign on the tenth day of the tenth month Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it.
The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.
Then the city wall was broken through and the whole army fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the kings garden though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah
but the Babylonian army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered
and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah where sentence was pronounced on him.
They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.
On the seventh day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard an official of the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem.
He set fire to the temple of the Lord the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.
The whole Babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city along with the rest of the populace and those who had gone over to the king of Babylon.
But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the Lord and they carried the bronze to Babylon.
They also took away the pots shovels wick trimmers dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.
The commander of the imperial guard took away the censers and sprinkling bowlsall that were made of pure gold or silver.
The bronze from the two pillars the Sea and the movable stands which Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord was more than could be weighed.
Each pillar was twentyseven feet high. The bronze capital on top of one pillar was four and a half feet high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar with its network was similar.
The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.
Of those still in the city he took the officer in charge of the fighting men and five royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of his men who were found in the city.
Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
There at Riblah in the land of Hamath the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity away from her land.
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan to be over the people he had left behind in Judah.
When all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor they came to Gedaliah at MizpahIshmael son of Nethaniah Johanan son of Kareah Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite and their men.
Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men. Do not be afraid of the Babylonian officials he said. Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon and it will go well with you.
In the seventh month however Ishmael son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama who was of royal blood came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah and also the men of Judah and the Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.
At this all the people from the least to the greatest together with the army officers fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.
In the thirtyseventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah in the year EvilMerodach became king of Babylon he released Jehoiachin from prison on the twentyseventh day of the twelfth month.
He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the kings table.
Day by day the king gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived.

Now the Philistines fought against Israel the Israelites fled before them and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons and they killed his sons Jonathan Abinadab and MalkiShua.
The fighting grew fierce around Saul and when the archers overtook him they wounded him.
Saul said to his armorbearer Draw your sword and run me through or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me. But his armorbearer was terrified and would not do it so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
When the armorbearer saw that Saul was dead he too fell on his sword and died.
So Saul and his three sons died and all his house died together.
When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.
The next day when the Philistines came to strip the dead they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
They stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people.
They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon.
When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul
all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh and they fasted seven days.
Saul died because he was unfaithful to the Lord he did not keep the word of the Lord and even consulted a medium for guidance
and did not inquire of the Lord. So the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said We are your own flesh and blood.
In the past even while Saul was king you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the Lord your God said to you You will shepherd my people Israel and you will become their ruler. 
When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron he made a compact with them at Hebron before the Lord and they anointed David king over Israel as the Lord had promised through Samuel.
David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem . The Jebusites who lived there
said to David You will not get in here. Nevertheless David captured the fortress of Zion the City of David.
David had said Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commanderinchief. Joab son of Zeruiah went up first and so he received the command.
David then took up residence in the fortress and so it was called the City of David.
He built up the city around it from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall while Joab restored the rest of the city.
And David became more and more powerful because the Lord Almighty was with him.
These were the chiefs of Davids mighty menthey together with all Israel gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land as the Lord had promised
this is the list of Davids mighty men Jashobeam a Hacmonite was chief of the officers he raised his spear against three hundred men whom he killed in one encounter.
Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite one of the three mighty men.
He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley the troops fled from the Philistines.
But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down and the Lord brought about a great victory.
Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
At that time David was in the stronghold and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
David longed for water and said Oh that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!
So the Three broke through the Philistine lines drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it instead he poured it out before the Lord.
God forbid that I should do this! he said. Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? Because they risked their lives to bring it back David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men whom he killed and so he became as famous as the Three.
He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander even though he was not included among them.
Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moabs best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weavers rod in his hand Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear.
Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada he too was as famous as the three mighty men.
He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
The mighty men were Asahel the brother of Joab Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem
Shammoth the Harorite Helez the Pelonite
Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa Abiezer from Anathoth

Hezro the Carmelite Naarai son of Ezbai
Joel the brother of Nathan Mibhar son of Hagri
Zelek the Ammonite Naharai the Berothite the armorbearer of Joab son of Zeruiah
These were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the warriors who helped him in battle
they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones righthanded or lefthanded they were kinsmen of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin)
Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth Beracah Jehu the Anathothite

Eluzai Jerimoth Bealiah Shemariah and Shephatiah the Haruphite
Elkanah Isshiah Azarel Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites
and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were brave warriors ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their faces were the faces of lions and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains.
Ezer was the chief Obadiah the second in command Eliab the third
Mishmannah the fourth Jeremiah the fifth
Attai the sixth Eliel the seventh
Johanan the eighth Elzabad the ninth
Jeremiah the tenth and Macbannai the eleventh.
David conferred with each of his officers the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
He then said to the whole assembly of Israel If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the Lord our God let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers throughout the territories of Israel and also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands to come and join us.
Let us bring the ark of our God back to us for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul.
The whole assembly agreed to do this because it seemed right to all the people.
So David assembled all the Israelites from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
David and all the Israelites with him went to Baalah of Judah  to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord who is enthroned between the cherubimthe ark that is called by the Name.
They moved the ark of God from Abinadabs house on a new cart with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it.
David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God with songs and with harps lyres tambourines cymbals and trumpets.
When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark because the oxen stumbled.
The Lords anger burned against Uzzah and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.
Then David was angry because the Lords wrath had broken out against Uzzah and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.
David was afraid of God that day and asked How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?
He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead he took it aside to the house of ObedEdom the Gittite.
The ark of God remained with the family of ObedEdom in his house for three months and the Lord blessed his household and everything he had.
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David along with cedar logs stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him.
And David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters.
These are the names of the children born to him there Shammua Shobab Nathan Solomon
Ibhar Elishua Elpelet
Nogah Nepheg Japhia
Elishama Beeliada and Eliphelet.
When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel they went up in full force to search for him but David heard about it and went out to meet them.
Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim
so David inquired of God Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me? The Lord answered him Go I will hand them over to you.
So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim and there he defeated them. He said As waters break out God has broken out against my enemies by my hand. So that place was called Baal Perazim.
The Philistines had abandoned their gods there and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.
Once more the Philistines raided the valley
so David inquired of God again and God answered him Do not go straight up but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees move out to battle because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army.
So David did as God commanded him and they struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
So Davids fame spread throughout every land and the Lord made all the nations fear him.
After David had constructed buildings for himself in the City of David he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
Then David said No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God because the Lord chose them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister before him forever.
David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place he had prepared for it.
He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites
From the descendants of Kohath Uriel the leader and 120 relatives
from the descendants of Merari Asaiah the leader and 220 relatives
from the descendants of Gershon Joel the leader and 130 relatives
from the descendants of Elizaphan Shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives
from the descendants of Hebron Eliel the leader and 80 relatives
from the descendants of Uzziel Amminadab the leader and 112 relatives.
Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests and Uriel Asaiah Joel Shemaiah Eliel and Amminadab the Levites.
He said to them You are the heads of the Levitical families you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.
It was because you the Levites did not bring it up the first time that the Lord our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way.
So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel.
And the Levites carried the ark of God with the poles on their shoulders as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the Lord.
David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers to sing joyful songs accompanied by musical instruments lyres harps and cymbals.
So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel from his brothers Asaph son of Berekiah and from their brothers the Merarites Ethan son of Kushaiah
and with them their brothers next in rank Zechariah Jaaziel Shemiramoth Jehiel Unni Eliab Benaiah Maaseiah Mattithiah Eliphelehu Mikneiah ObedEdom and Jeiel the gatekeepers.
The musicians Heman Asaph and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals
Zechariah Aziel Shemiramoth Jehiel Unni Eliab Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play the lyres according to alamoth
and Mattithiah Eliphelehu Mikneiah ObedEdom Jeiel and Azaziah were to play the harps directing according to sheminith.
Kenaniah the head Levite was in charge of the singing that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it.
Berekiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark.
Shebaniah Joshaphat Nethanel Amasai Zechariah Benaiah and Eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. ObedEdom and Jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the ark.
So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of ObedEdom with rejoicing.
Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed.
Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark and as were the singers and Kenaniah who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod.
So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouts with the sounding of rams horns and trumpets and of cymbals and the playing of lyres and harps.
As the ark of the covenant of the Lord was entering the City of David Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David dancing and celebrating she despised him in her heart.
They brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God.
After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
Then he gave a loaf of bread a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each Israelite man and woman.
He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord to make petition to give thanks and to praise the Lord the God of Israel
Asaph was the chief Zechariah second then Jeiel Shemiramoth Jehiel Mattithiah Eliab Benaiah ObedEdom and Jeiel. They were to play the lyres and harps Asaph was to sound the cymbals
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
That day David first committed to Asaph and his associates this psalm of thanks to the Lord
Give thanks to the Lord call on his name make known among the nations what he has done.
Sing to him sing praise to him tell of all his wonderful acts.
Glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
Look to the Lord and his strength seek his face always.
Remember the wonders he has done his miracles and the judgments he pronounced
O descendants of Israel his servant O sons of Jacob his chosen ones.
He is the Lord our God his judgments are in all the earth.
He remembers his covenant forever the word he commanded for a thousand generations
the covenant he made with Abraham the oath he swore to Isaac.
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree to Israel as an everlasting covenant
To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.
When they were but few in number few indeed and strangers in it
they wandered from nation to nation from one kingdom to another.
He allowed no man to oppress them for their sake he rebuked kings
Do not touch my anointed ones do my prophets no harm.
Sing to the Lord all the earth proclaim his salvation day after day.
Declare his glory among the nations his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise he is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are idols but the Lord made the heavens.
After David was settled in his palace he said to Nathan the prophet Here I am living in a palace of cedar while the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under a tent.
Nathan replied to David Whatever you have in mind do it for God is with you.
That night the word of God came to Nathan saying
Go and tell my servant David This is what the Lord says You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.
I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another from one dwelling place to another.
Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people Why have you not built me a house of cedar? 
Now then tell my servant David This is what the Lord Almighty says I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel.
I have been with you wherever you have gone and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth.
And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore as they did at the beginning
and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies.  I declare to you that the Lord will build a house for you
When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers I will raise up your offspring to succeed you one of your own sons and I will establish his kingdom.
He is the one who will build a house for me and I will establish his throne forever.
I will be his father and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him as I took it away from your predecessor.
I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever his throne will be established forever. 
Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
Then King David went in and sat before the Lord and he said Who am I O Lord God and what is my family that you have brought me this far?
In the course of time David defeated the Philistines and subdued them and he took Gath and its surrounding villages from the control of the Philistines.
David also defeated the Moabites and they became subject to him and brought tribute.
Moreover David fought Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath when he went to establish his control along the Euphrates River.
David captured a thousand of his chariots seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah David struck down twentytwo thousand of them.
He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The Lord gave David victory everywhere he went.
David took the gold shields carried by the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
From Tebah and Cun towns that belonged to Hadadezer David took a great quantity of bronze which Solomon used to make the bronze Sea the pillars and various bronze articles.
When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah
he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze.
King David dedicated these articles to the Lord as he had done with the silver and gold he had taken from all these nations Edom and Moab the Ammonites and the Philistines and Amalek.
Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
He put garrisons in Edom and all the Edomites became subject to David. The Lord gave David victory everywhere he went.
David reigned over all Israel doing what was just and right for all his people.
Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder
Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests Shavsha was secretary
Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites and Davids sons were chief officials at the kings side.
In the course of time Nahash king of the Ammonites died and his son succeeded him as king.
David thought I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When Davids men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him
the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Havent his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?
So Hanun seized Davids men shaved them cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks and sent them away.
When someone came and told David about the men he sent messengers to meet them for they were greatly humiliated. The king said Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown and then come back.
When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in Davids nostrils Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim Aram Maacah and Zobah.
They hired thirtytwo thousand chariots and charioteers as well as the king of Maacah with his troops who came and camped near Medeba while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.
In the spring at the time when kings go off to war Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins.
David took the crown from the head of their king its weight was found to be a talent of gold and it was set with precious stonesand it was placed on Davids head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city
and brought out the people who were there consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
In the course of time war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai one of the descendants of the Rephaites and the Philistines were subjugated.
In another battle with the Philistines Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite who had a spear with a shaft like a weavers rod.
In still another battle which took place at Gath there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foottwentyfour in all. He also was descended from Rapha.
When he taunted Israel Jonathan son of Shimea Davids brother killed him.
These were descendants of Rapha in Gath and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.
So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are.
But Joab replied May the Lord multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king are they not all my lords subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?
The kings word however overruled Joab so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.
Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering because the kings command was repulsive to him.
This command was also evil in the sight of God so he punished Israel.
Then David said to God I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now I beg you take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.
The Lord said to Gad Davids seer
Go and tell David This is what the Lord says I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you. 
So Gad went to David and said to him This is what the Lord says Take your choice
three years of famine three months of being swept away before your enemies with their swords overtaking you or three days of the sword of the Lorddays of plague in the land with the angel of the Lord ravaging every part of Israel. Now then decide how I should answer the one who sent me.
David said to Gad I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the Lord for his mercy is very great but do not let me fall into the hands of men.
So the Lord sent a plague on Israel and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so the Lord saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people Enough! Withdraw your hand. The angel of the Lord was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders clothed in sackcloth fell facedown.
David said to God Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O Lord my God let your hand fall upon me and my family but do not let this plague remain on your people.
Then the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
Then David said The house of the Lord God is to be here and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
So David gave orders to assemble the aliens living in Israel and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God.
He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings and more bronze than could be weighed.
He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.
David said My son Solomon is young and inexperienced and the house to be built for the Lord should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it. So David made extensive preparations before his death.
Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the Lord the God of Israel.
David said to Solomon My son I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the Lord my God.
But this word of the Lord came to me You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.
Now my son the Lord be with you and may you have success and build the house of the Lord your God as he said you would.
May the Lord give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel so that you may keep the law of the Lord your God.
Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the Lord gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold a million talents of silver quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed and wood and stone. And you may add to them.
You have many workmen stonecutters masons and carpenters as well as men skilled in every kind of work
in gold and silver bronze and ironcraftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work and the Lord be with you.
Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
He said to them Is not the Lord your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me and the land is subject to the Lord and to his people.
Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the Lord your God. Begin to build the sanctuary of the Lord God so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the sacred articles belonging to God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the Lord.
When David was old and full of years he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel as well as the priests and Levites.
The Levites thirty years old or more were counted and the total number of men was thirtyeight thousand.
David said Of these twentyfour thousand are to supervise the work of the temple of the Lord and six thousand are to be officials and judges.
Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the Lord with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose.
David divided the Levites into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi Gershon Kohath and Merari.
The sons of Hebron Jeriah the first Amariah the second Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
The sons of Uzziel Micah the first and Isshiah the second.
The sons of Merari Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli Eleazar and Kish.
Eleazar died without having sons he had only daughters. Their cousins the sons of Kish married them.
The sons of Mushi Mahli Eder and Jerimoththree in all.
These were the descendants of Levi by their familiesthe heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually that is the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the Lord.
For David had said Since the Lord the God of Israel has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever
the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service.
According to the last instructions of David the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.
The duty of the Levites was to help Aarons descendants in the service of the temple of the Lord to be in charge of the courtyards the side rooms the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.
They were in charge of the bread set out on the table the flour for the grain offerings the unleavened wafers the baking and the mixing and all measurements of quantity and size.
They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord. They were to do the same in the evening
These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron The sons of Aaron were Nadab Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar.
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did and they had no sons so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests.
With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering.
A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazars descendants than among Ithamars and they were divided accordingly sixteen heads of families from Eleazars descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamars descendants.
They divided them impartially by drawing lots for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.
The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel a Levite recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials Zadok the priest Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levitesone family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.

King David rose to his feet and said Listen to me my brothers and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord for the footstool of our God and I made plans to build it.
But God said to me You are not to build a house for my Name because you are a warrior and have shed blood.
Yet the Lord the God of Israel chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader and from the house of Judah he chose my family and from my fathers sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.
Of all my sonsand the Lord has given me manyhe has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
He said to me Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts for I have chosen him to be my son and I will be his father.
I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws as is being done at this time.
So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the Lord and in the hearing of our God Be careful to follow all the commands of the Lord your God that you may possess this good land and pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever.
And you my son Solomon acknowledge the God of your father and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind for the Lord searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts. If you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will reject you forever.
Consider now for the Lord has chosen you to build a temple as a sanctuary. Be strong and do the work.
Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple its buildings its storerooms its upper parts its inner rooms and the place of atonement.
He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the Lord and all the surrounding rooms for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things.
He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites and for all the work of serving in the temple of the Lord as well as for all the articles to be used in its service.
He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service
the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps according to the use of each lampstand
the weight of gold for each table for consecrated bread the weight of silver for the silver tables
the weight of pure gold for the forks sprinkling bowls and pitchers the weight of gold for each gold dish the weight of silver for each silver dish
and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot that is the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and shelter the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
All this David said I have in writing from the hand of the Lord upon me and he gave me understanding in all the details of the plan.
David also said to Solomon his son Be strong and courageous and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged for the Lord God my God is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the Lord is finished.
The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God and every willing man skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command.
Then King David said to the whole assembly My son Solomon the one whom God has chosen is young and inexperienced. The task is great because this palatial structure is not for man but for the Lord God.
With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my Godgold for the gold work silver for the silver bronze for the bronze iron for the iron and wood for the wood as well as onyx for the settings turquoise stones of various colors and all kinds of fine stone and marbleall of these in large quantities.
Besides in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple
three thousand talents of gold  and seven thousand talents of refined silver for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings
for the gold work and the silver work and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who is willing to consecrate himself today to the Lord?
Then the leaders of families the officers of the tribes of Israel the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and the officials in charge of the kings work gave willingly.
They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold ten thousand talents of silver eighteen thousand talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron.
Any who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the Lord in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.
The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced greatly.
David praised the Lord in the presence of the whole assembly saying Praise be to you O Lord God of our father Israel from everlasting to everlasting.
Yours O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours O Lord is the kingdom you are exalted as head over all.
Wealth and honor come from you you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.
Now our God we give you thanks and praise your glorious name.
But who am I and who are my people that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you and we have given you only what comes from your hand.
We are aliens and strangers in your sight as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow without hope.
O Lord our God as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name it comes from your hand and all of it belongs to you.
Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom for the Lord his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
Then Solomon spoke to all Israelto the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel the heads of families
and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon for Gods Tent of Meeting was there which Moses the Lords servant had made in the desert.
Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri the son of Hur had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the Lord so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.
Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the Lord in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him Ask for whatever you want me to give you.
Solomon answered God You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.
Now Lord God let your promise to my father David be confirmed for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.
Give me wisdom and knowledge that I may lead this people for who is able to govern this great people of yours?
God said to Solomon Since this is your hearts desire and you have not asked for wealth riches or honor nor for the death of your enemies and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king
therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth riches and honor such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.
Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon from before the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned over Israel.
Solomon accumulated chariots and horses he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones and cedar as plentiful as sycamorefig trees in the foothills.
Solomons horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.
They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.
Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the Lord and a royal palace for himself.
He conscripted seventy thousand men as carriers and eighty thousand as stonecutters in the hills and thirtysix hundred as foremen over them.
Solomon sent this message to Hiram king of Tyre Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.
Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the Lord my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him for setting out the consecrated bread regularly and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on Sabbaths and New Moons and at the appointed feasts of the Lord our God. This is a lasting ordinance for Israel.
The temple I am going to build will be great because our God is greater than all other gods.
But who is able to build a temple for him since the heavens even the highest heavens cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?
Send me therefore a man skilled to work in gold and silver bronze and iron and in purple crimson and blue yarn and experienced in the art of engraving to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen whom my father David provided.
Send me also cedar pine and algum logs from Lebanon for I know that your men are skilled in cutting timber there. My men will work with yours
to provide me with plenty of lumber because the temple I build must be large and magnificent.
I will give your servants the woodsmen who cut the timber twenty thousand cors of ground wheat twenty thousand cors of barley twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil.
whose mother was from Dan and whose father was from Tyre. He is trained to work in gold and silver bronze and iron stone and wood and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and with those of my lord David your father.
Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised
and we will cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need and will float them in rafts by sea down to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.
Then Solomon began to build the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where the Lord had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite the place provided by David.
He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide .
The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
He paneled the main hall with pine and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.
He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim.
The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.
In the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.
He erected the pillars in the front of the temple one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.
He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
He made the Sea of cast metal circular in shape measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.
Below the rim figures of bulls encircled itten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
The Sea stood on twelve bulls three facing north three facing west three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them and their hindquarters were toward the center.
It was a handbreadth in thickness and its rim was like the rim of a cup like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths.
He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.
He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple five on the south side and five on the north.
He made ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.
He made the courtyard of the priests and the large court and the doors for the court and overlaid the doors with bronze.
He placed the Sea on the south side at the southeast corner.
When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the Lord was finished he brought in the things his father David had dedicatedthe silver and gold and all the furnishingsand he placed them in the treasuries of Gods temple.
Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families to bring up the ark of the Lords covenant from Zion the City of David.
And all the men of Israel came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.
When all the elders of Israel had arrived the Levites took up the ark
and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests who were Levites carried them up
and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
The priests then brought the ark of the Lords covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple the Most Holy Place and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles.
These poles were so long that their ends extending from the ark could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary but not from outside the Holy Place and they are still there today.
There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions.
All the Levites who were musiciansAsaph Heman Jeduthun and their sons and relativesstood on the east side of the altar dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
The trumpeters and singers joined in unison as with one voice to give praise and thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets cymbals and other instruments they raised their voices in praise to the Lord and sang He is good his love endures forever. Then the temple of the Lord was filled with a cloud
and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God.
Then Solomon said The Lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud
I have built a magnificent temple for you a place for you to dwell forever.
While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there the king turned around and blessed them.
Then he said Praise be to the Lord the God of Israel who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David. For he said
Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there nor have I chosen anyone to be the leader over my people Israel.
But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.
My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the Lord the God of Israel.
But the Lord said to my father David Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name you did well to have this in your heart.
Nevertheless you are not the one to build the temple but your son who is your own flesh and bloodhe is the one who will build the temple for my Name.
The Lord has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel just as the Lord promised and I have built the temple for the Name of the Lord the God of Israel.
There I have placed the ark in which is the covenant of the Lord that he made with the people of Israel.
Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
Now he had made a bronze platform five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
He said O Lord God of Israel there is no God like you in heaven or on earthyou who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.
You have kept your promise to your servant David my father with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled itas it is today.
Now Lord God of Israel keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said You shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my law as you have done.
And now O Lord God of Israel let your word that you promised your servant David come true.
But will God really dwell on earth with men? The heavens even the highest heavens cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
Yet give attention to your servants prayer and his plea for mercy O Lord my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence.
May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night this place of which you said you would put your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.
Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven your dwelling place and when you hear forgive.
When Solomon finished praying fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
The priests could not enter the temple of the Lord because the glory of the Lord filled it.
When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the temple they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground and they worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord saying He is good his love endures forever.
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.
And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twentytwo thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.
The priests took their positions as did the Levites with the Lords musical instruments which King David had made for praising the Lord and which were used when he gave thanks saying His love endures forever. Opposite the Levites the priests blew their trumpets and all the Israelites were standing.
Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings the grain offerings and the fat portions.
So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days and all Israel with hima vast assembly people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt.
On the eighth day they held an assembly for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more.
On the twentythird day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes joyful and glad in heart for the good things the Lord had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.
When Solomon had finished the temple of the Lord and the royal palace and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the Lord and in his own palace
the Lord appeared to him at night and said I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.
When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people
if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
As for you if you walk before me as David your father did and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws
At the end of twenty years during which Solomon built the temple of the Lord and his own palace
Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram had given him and settled Israelites in them.
Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and captured it.
He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath.
He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities with walls and with gates and bars
as well as Baalath and all his store cities and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.
All the people left from the Hittites Amorites Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites 
that is their descendants remaining in the land whom the Israelites had not destroyedthese Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force as it is to this day.
But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work they were his fighting men commanders of his captains and commanders of his chariots and charioteers.
They were also King Solomons chief officialstwo hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.
Solomon brought Pharaohs daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her for he said My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel because the places the ark of the Lord has entered are holy.
On the altar of the Lord that he had built in front of the portico Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the Lord
according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for Sabbaths New Moons and the three annual feaststhe Feast of Unleavened Bread the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles.
In keeping with the ordinance of his father David he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each days requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates because this was what David the man of God had ordered.
They did not deviate from the kings commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter including that of the treasuries.
All Solomons work was carried out from the day the foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid until its completion. So the temple of the Lord was finished.
Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.
And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers men who knew the sea. These with Solomons men sailed to Ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents of gold which they delivered to King Solomon.
When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomons fame she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravanwith camels carrying spices large quantities of gold and precious stonesshe came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind.
Solomon answered all her questions nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.
When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon as well as the palace he had built
the food on his table the seating of his officials the attending servants in their robes the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the Lord she was overwhelmed.
She said to the king The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.
But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me you have far exceeded the report I heard.
How happy your men must be! How happy your officials who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
Praise be to the Lord your God who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the Lord your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever he has made you king over them to maintain justice and righteousness.
Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold large quantities of spices and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
(The men of Hiram and the men of Solomon brought gold from Ophir they also brought algumwood and precious stones.
The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the Lord and for the royal palace and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Judah.)
King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents
not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold six hundred bekas of hammered gold went into each shield.
He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold with three hundred bekas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with pure gold.
The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests with a lion standing beside each of them.
Rehoboam went to Shechem for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.
When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this  he returned from Egypt.
So they sent for Jeroboam and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him
Your father put a heavy yoke on us but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us and we will serve you.
Rehoboam answered Come back to me in three days. So the people went away.
Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. How would you advise me to answer these people? he asked.
They replied If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants.
But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
He asked them What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me Lighten the yoke your father put on us?
The young men who had grown up with him replied Tell the people who have said to you Your father put a heavy yoke on us but make our yoke lightertell them My little finger is thicker than my fathers waist.
My father laid on you a heavy yoke I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips I will scourge you with scorpions. 
Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam as the king had said Come back to me in three days.
The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders
he followed the advice of the young men and said My father made your yoke heavy I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips I will scourge you with scorpions.
So the king did not listen to the people for this turn of events was from God to fulfill the word the Lord had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them they answered the king What share do we have in David what part in Jesses son? To your tents O Israel! Look after your own house O David! So all the Israelites went home.
But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah Rehoboam still ruled over them.
King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram who was in charge of forced labor but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam however managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem he mustered the house of Judah and Benjamina hundred and eighty thousand fighting mento make war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam.
But this word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God
Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin
This is what the Lord says Do not go up to fight against your brothers. Go home every one of you for this is my doing.  So they obeyed the words of the Lord and turned back from marching against Jeroboam.
Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah
Bethlehem Etam Tekoa
Beth Zur Soco Adullam
Gath Mareshah Ziph
Adoraim Lachish Azekah
Zorah Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them with supplies of food olive oil and wine.
He put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.
The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him.
The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the Lord.
And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made.
After Rehoboams position as king was established and he had become strong he and all Israel with him abandoned the law of the Lord.
Because they had been unfaithful to the Lord Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam.
With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans Sukkites and Cushites that came with him from Egypt
he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak and he said to them This is what the Lord says You have abandoned me therefore I now abandon you to Shishak. 
The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said The Lord is just.
When the Lord saw that they humbled themselves this word of the Lord came to Shemaiah Since they have humbled themselves I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
They will however become subject to him so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.
When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem he carried off the treasures of the temple of the Lord and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything including the gold shields Solomon had made.
So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
Whenever the king went to the Lords temple the guards went with him bearing the shields and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.
Because Rehoboam humbled himself the Lords anger turned from him and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed there was some good in Judah.
King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was fortyone years old when he became king and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mothers name was Naamah she was an Ammonite.
He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the Lord.
As for the events of Rehoboams reign from beginning to end are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam Abijah became king of Judah
and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mothers name was Maacah a daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
Abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.
Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and said Jeroboam and all Israel listen to me!
Dont you know that the Lord the God of Israel has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?
Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat an official of Solomon son of David rebelled against his master.
Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.
And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the Lord which is in the hands of Davids descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.
But didnt you drive out the priests of the Lord the sons of Aaron and the Levites and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods.
As for us the Lord is our God and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the Lord are sons of Aaron and the Levites assist them.
Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the Lord. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the Lord our God. But you have forsaken him.
God is with us he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. Men of Israel do not fight against the Lord the God of your fathers for you will not succeed.
Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them.
Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the Lord. The priests blew their trumpets
And Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeded him as king and in his days the country was at peace for ten years.
Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
He removed the foreign altars and the high places smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.
He commanded Judah to seek the Lord the God of their fathers and to obey his laws and commands.
He removed the high places and incense altars in every town in Judah and the kingdom was at peace under him.
He built up the fortified cities of Judah since the land was at peace. No one was at war with him during those years for the Lord gave him rest.
Let us build up these towns he said to Judah and put walls around them with towers gates and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the Lord our God we sought him and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah equipped with large shields and with spears and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin armed with small shields and with bows. All these were brave fighting men.
Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with a vast army and three hundred chariots and came as far as Mareshah.
Asa went out to meet him and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
Then Asa called to the Lord his God and said  Lord there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us O Lord our God for we rely on you and in your name we have come against this vast army. O Lord you are our God do not let man prevail against you.
The Lord struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled
and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover they were crushed before the Lord and his forces. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder.
They destroyed all the villages around Gerar for the terror of the Lord had fallen upon them. They plundered all these villages since there was much booty there.
They also attacked the camps of the herdsmen and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
The Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded.
He went out to meet Asa and said to him Listen to me Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The Lord is with you when you are with him. If you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will forsake you.
For a long time Israel was without the true God without a priest to teach and without the law.
But in their distress they turned to the Lord the God of Israel and sought him and he was found by them.
In those days it was not safe to travel about for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil.
One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another because God was troubling them with every kind of distress.
But as for you be strong and do not give up for your work will be rewarded.
When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet he took courage. He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the Lord that was in front of the portico of the Lords temple.
Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asas reign.
At that time they sacrificed to the Lord seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back.
They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord the God of their fathers with all their heart and soul.
All who would not seek the Lord the God of Israel were to be put to death whether small or great man or woman.
In the thirtysixth year of Asas reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the Lords temple and of his own palace and sent it to BenHadad king of Aram who was ruling in Damascus.
Let there be a treaty between me and you he said as there was between my father and your father. See I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me.
BenHadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon Dan Abel Maim and all the store cities of Naphtali.
When Baasha heard this he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work.
Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah.
At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the Lord your God the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the Lord he delivered them into your hand.
For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing and from now on you will be at war.
Asa was angry with the seer because of this he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.
The events of Asas reign from beginning to end are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
In the thirtyninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe even in his illness he did not seek help from the Lord but only from the physicians.
Then in the fortyfirst year of his reign Asa died and rested with his fathers.
They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes and they made a huge fire in his honor.
Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.
He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the Baals
but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.
The Lord established the kingdom under his control and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat so that he had great wealth and honor.
His heart was devoted to the ways of the Lord furthermore he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.
In the third year of his reign he sent his officials BenHail Obadiah Zechariah Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.
With them were certain LevitesShemaiah Nethaniah Zebadiah Asahel Shemiramoth Jehonathan Adonijah Tobijah and TobAdonijahand the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
They taught throughout Judah taking with them the Book of the Law of the Lord they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.
The fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.
Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute and the Arabs brought him flocks seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.
Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful he built forts and store cities in Judah
and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.
Their enrollment by families was as follows From Judah commanders of units of 1000 Adnah the commander with 300000 fighting men
next Jehohanan the commander with 280000
next Amasiah son of Zicri who volunteered himself for the service of the Lord with 200000.
From Benjamin Eliada a valiant soldier with 200000 men armed with bows and shields
next Jehozabad with 180000 men armed for battle.
These were the men who served the king besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.
Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.
Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead? Jehoshaphat replied I am as you are and my people as your people we will join you in the war.
But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel First seek the counsel of the Lord.
So the king of Israel brought together the prophetsfour hundred menand asked them Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead or shall I refrain? Go they answered for God will give it into the kings hand.
But Jehoshaphat asked Is there not a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?
The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the Lord but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah. The king should not say that Jehoshaphat replied.
So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.
Dressed in their royal robes the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria with all the prophets prophesying before them.
Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared This is what the Lord says With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed. 
When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem
Jehu the seer the son of Hanani went out to meet him and said to the king Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Because of this the wrath of the Lord is upon you.
There is however some good in you for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God.
Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the Lord the God of their fathers.
He appointed judges in the land in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
He told them Consider carefully what you do because you are not judging for man but for the Lord who is with you whenever you give a verdict.
Now let the fear of the Lord be upon you. Judge carefully for with the Lord our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.
In Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the Lord and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem.
He gave them these orders You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the Lord.
In every case that comes before you from your fellow countrymen who live in the citieswhether bloodshed or other concerns of the law commands decrees or ordinancesyou are to warn them not to sin against the Lord otherwise his wrath will come on you and your brothers. Do this and you will not sin.
Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the Lord and Zebadiah son of Ishmael the leader of the tribe of Judah will be over you in any matter concerning the king and the Levites will serve as officials before you. Act with courage and may the Lord be with those who do well.
After this the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites came to make war on Jehoshaphat.
Some men came and told Jehoshaphat A vast army is coming against you from Edom from the other side of the Sea. It is already in Hazazon Tamar .
Alarmed Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the Lord and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah.
The people of Judah came together to seek help from the Lord indeed they came from every town in Judah to seek him.
Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the Lord in the front of the new courtyard
and said O Lord God of our fathers are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand and no one can withstand you.
O our God did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?
They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name saying
If calamity comes upon us whether the sword of judgment or plague or famine we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress and you will hear us and save us.
But now here are men from Ammon Moab and Mount Seir whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt so they turned away from them and did not destroy them.
See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.
O our God will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do but our eyes are upon you.
All the men of Judah with their wives and children and little ones stood there before the Lord.
Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah the son of Benaiah the son of Jeiel the son of Mattaniah a Levite and descendant of Asaph as he stood in the assembly.
He said Listen King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the Lord says to you Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours but Gods.
Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.
You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give you O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow and the Lord will be with you. 
Jehoshaphat bowed with his face to the ground and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the Lord.
Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the Lord the God of Israel with very loud voice.
Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
Jehorams brothers the sons of Jehoshaphat were Azariah Jehiel Zechariah Azariahu Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value as well as fortified cities in Judah but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.
When Jehoram established himself firmly over his fathers kingdom he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the princes of Israel.
Jehoram was thirtytwo years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
Nevertheless because of the covenant the Lord had made with David the Lord was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.
In the time of Jehoram Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.
So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders but he rose up and broke through by night.
To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time because Jehoram had forsaken the Lord the God of his fathers.
The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah Jehorams youngest son king in his place since the raiders who came with the Arabs into the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
Ahaziah was twentytwo years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mothers name was Athaliah a granddaughter of Omri.
He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as the house of Ahab had done for after his fathers death they became his advisers to his undoing.
He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram
so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.
Through Ahaziahs visit to Joram God brought about Ahaziahs downfall. When Ahaziah arrived he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziahs relatives who had been attending Ahaziah and he killed them.
He then went in search of Ahaziah and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him for they said He was a son of Jehoshaphat who sought the Lord with all his heart. So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom.
When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah.
But Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada was Ahaziahs sister she hid the child from Athaliah so she could not kill him.
He remained hidden with them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred Azariah son of Jeroham Ishmael son of Jehohanan Azariah son of Obed Maaseiah son of Adaiah and Elishaphat son of Zicri.
They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem
the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them The kings son shall reign as the Lord promised concerning the descendants of David.
Now this is what you are to do A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors
a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate and all the other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the Lord.
No one is to enter the temple of the Lord except the priests and Levites on duty they may enter because they are consecrated but all the other men are to guard what the Lord has assigned to them.
The Levites are to station themselves around the king each man with his weapons in his hand. Anyone who enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes.
The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his menthose who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off dutyfor Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.
He stationed all the men each with his weapon in his hand around the kingnear the altar and the temple from the south side to the north side of the temple.
Jehoiada and his sons brought out the kings son and put the crown on him they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted Long live the king!
When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king she went to them at the temple of the Lord.
She looked and there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets and singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted Treason! Treason!
Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred who were in charge of the troops and said to them Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her. For the priest had said Do not put her to death at the temple of the Lord.
So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds and there they put her to death.
Jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the king would be the Lords people.
All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the Lord in the hands of the priests who were Levites to whom David had made assignments in the temple to present the burnt offerings of the Lord as written in the Law of Moses with rejoicing and singing as David had ordered.
He also stationed doorkeepers at the gates of the Lords temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.
He took with him the commanders of hundreds the nobles the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the Lord. They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne
and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet because Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
Joash was seven years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mothers name was Zibiah she was from Beersheba.
Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the years of Jehoiada the priest.
Jehoiada chose two wives for him and he had sons and daughters.
Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the Lord.
He called together the priests and Levites and said to them Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel to repair the temple of your God. Do it now. But the Levites did not act at once.
Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him Why havent you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the Lord and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?
Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.
At the kings command a chest was made and placed outside at the gate of the temple of the Lord.
A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the Lord the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert.
All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly dropping them into the chest until it was full.
Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the kings officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.
The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the Lord. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the Lords temple and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.
The men in charge of the work were diligent and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it.
When they had finished they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada and with it were made articles for the Lords temple articles for the service and for the burnt offerings and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the Lord.
Now Jehoiada was old and full of years and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.
He was buried with the kings in the City of David because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.
After the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king and he listened to them.
They abandoned the temple of the Lord the God of their fathers and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt Gods anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem.
Although the Lord sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him and though they testified against them they would not listen.
Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said This is what God says Why do you disobey the Lords commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the Lord he has forsaken you. 
But they plotted against him and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lords temple.
King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariahs father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son who said as he lay dying May the Lord see this and call you to account.
At the turn of the year the army of Aram marched against Joash it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.
Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men the Lord delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers judgment was executed on Joash.
When the Arameans withdrew they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David but not in the tombs of the kings.
Those who conspired against him were Zabad son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman and Jehozabad son of Shimrith a Moabite woman.
The account of his sons the many prophecies about him and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
Amaziah was twentyfive years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem twentynine years. His mothers name was Jehoaddin she was from Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but not wholeheartedly.
After the kingdom was firmly in his control he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.
Yet he did not put their sons to death but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law in the Book of Moses where the Lord commanded Fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children put to death for their fathers each is to die for his own sins.
Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service able to handle the spear and shield.
He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
But a man of God came to him and said O king these troops from Israel must not march with you for the Lord is not with Israelnot with any of the people of Ephraim.
Even if you go and fight courageously in battle God will overthrow you before the enemy for God has the power to help or to overthrow.
Amaziah asked the man of God But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops? The man of God replied The Lord can give you much more than that.
So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.
Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.
The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.
Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided Judean towns from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them.
The anger of the Lord burned against Amaziah and he sent a prophet to him who said Why do you consult this peoples gods which could not save their own people from your hand?
While he was still speaking the king said to him Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down? So the prophet stopped but said I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.
After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers he sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel Come meet me face to face.
But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon Give your daughter to my son in marriage. Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?
Amaziah however would not listen for God so worked that he might hand them over to Jehoash because they sought the gods of Edom.
So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
Judah was routed by Israel and every man fled to his home.
Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his fathers.
Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem fiftytwo years. His mothers name was Jecoliah she was from Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord just as his father Amaziah had done.
He sought God during the days of Zechariah who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the Lord God gave him success.
He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites.
The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt because he had become very powerful.
Jotham was twentyfive years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mothers name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord just as his father Uzziah had done but unlike him he did not enter the temple of the Lord. The people however continued their corrupt practices.
Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the Lord and did extensive work on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
He built towns in the Judean hills and forts and towers in the wooded areas.
Jotham made war on the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites paid him a hundred talents of silver ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand cors of barley. The Ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years.
Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the Lord his God.
The other events in Jothams reign including all his wars and the other things he did are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
He was twentyfive years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord.
He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the Baals.
He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire following the detestable ways of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
Therefore the Lord his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel who inflicted heavy casualties on him.
In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judahbecause Judah had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers.
Zicri an Ephraimite warrior killed Maaseiah the kings son Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace and Elkanah second to the king.
The Israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder which they carried back to Samaria.
But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them Because the Lord the God of your fathers was angry with Judah he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.
And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But arent you also guilty of sins against the Lord your God?
Now listen to me! Send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners for the Lords fierce anger rests on you.
Then some of the leaders in EphraimAzariah son of Jehohanan Berekiah son of Meshillemoth Jehizkiah son of Shallum and Amasa son of Hadlaiconfronted those who were arriving from the war.
You must not bring those prisoners here they said or we will be guilty before the Lord. Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already great and his fierce anger rests on Israel.
So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.
The men designated by name took the prisoners and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals food and drink and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow countrymen at Jericho the City of Palms and returned to Samaria.
At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.
The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners
while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh Aijalon and Gederoth as well as Soco Timnah and Gimzo with their surrounding villages.
The Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel for he had promoted wickedness in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the Lord.
TiglathPileser king of Assyria came to him but he gave him trouble instead of help.
Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the Lord and from the royal palace and from the princes and presented them to the king of Assyria but that did not help him.
In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the Lord.
He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus who had defeated him for he thought Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them I will sacrifice to them so they will help me. But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.
Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and took them away. He shut the doors of the Lords temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.
In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and provoked the Lord the God of his fathers to anger.
The other events of his reign and all his ways from beginning to end are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
Hezekiah was twentyfive years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem twentynine years. His mothers name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord just as his father David had done.
In the first month of the first year of his reign he opened the doors of the temple of the Lord and repaired them.
He brought in the priests and the Levites assembled them in the square on the east side
and said Listen to me Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the Lord the God of your fathers. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary.
Our fathers were unfaithful they did evil in the eyes of the Lord our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the Lords dwelling place and turned their backs on him.
They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
Therefore the anger of the Lord has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn as you can see with your own eyes.
This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity.
Now I intend to make a covenant with the Lord the God of Israel so that his fierce anger will turn away from us.
My sons do not be negligent now for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him and serve him to minister before him and to burn incense.
Then these Levites set to work from the Kohathites Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Merarites Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Gershonites Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah
from the descendants of Elizaphan Shimri and Jeiel from the descendants of Asaph Zechariah and Mattaniah
from the descendants of Heman Jehiel and Shimei from the descendants of Jeduthun Shemaiah and Uzziel.
When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves they went in to purify the temple of the Lord as the king had ordered following the word of the Lord.
The priests went into the sanctuary of the Lord to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the Lords temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the Lord. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.
They began the consecration on the first day of the first month and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the Lord. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the Lord itself finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.
Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported We have purified the entire temple of the Lord the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils and the table for setting out the consecrated bread with all its articles.
We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the Lords altar.
Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the Lord.
They brought seven bulls seven rams seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests the descendants of Aaron to offer these on the altar of the Lord.
So they slaughtered the bulls and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar.
The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly and they laid their hands on them.
The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
He stationed the Levites in the temple of the Lord with cymbals harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the kings seer and Nathan the prophet this was commanded by the Lord through his prophets.
So the Levites stood ready with Davids instruments and the priests with their trumpets.
Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh inviting them to come to the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the Lord the God of Israel.
The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.
They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.
The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly.
They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the Lord the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written.
At the kings command couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials which read People of Israel return to the Lord the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel that he may return to you who are left who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
Do not be like your fathers and brothers who were unfaithful to the Lord the God of their fathers so that he made them an object of horror as you see.
Do not be stiffnecked as your fathers were submit to the Lord. Come to the sanctuary which he has consecrated forever. Serve the Lord your God so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.
If you return to the Lord then your brothers and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will come back to this land for the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him.
The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun but the people scorned and ridiculed them.
Nevertheless some men of Asher Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered following the word of the Lord.
A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the Lord.
Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood handed to them by the Levites.
Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs to the Lord.
Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim Manasseh Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them saying May the Lord who is good pardon everyone
who sets his heart on seeking Godthe Lord the God of his fatherseven if he is not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary.
And the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
When all this had ended the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.
Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisionseach of them according to their duties as priests or Levitesto offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to minister to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the Lords dwelling.
The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths New Moons and appointed feasts as written in the Law of the Lord.
He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the Lord.
As soon as the order went out the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain new wine oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount a tithe of everything.
The men of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the Lord their God and they piled them in heaps.
They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month.
When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps they praised the Lord and blessed his people Israel.
Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps
and Azariah the chief priest from the family of Zadok answered Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the Lord we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare because the Lord has blessed his people and this great amount is left over.
Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the Lord and this was done.
Then they faithfully brought in the contributions tithes and dedicated gifts. Conaniah a Levite was in charge of these things and his brother Shimei was next in rank.
Jehiel Azaziah Nahath Asahel Jerimoth Jozabad Eliel Ismakiah Mahath and Benaiah were supervisors under Conaniah and Shimei his brother by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.
Kore son of Imnah the Levite keeper of the East Gate was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God distributing the contributions made to the Lord and also the consecrated gifts.
Eden Miniamin Jeshua Shemaiah Amariah and Shecaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions old and young alike.
In addition they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical recordsall who would enter the temple of the Lord to perform the daily duties of their various tasks according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
They included all the little ones the wives and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.
As for the priests the descendants of Aaron who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.
This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah doing what was good and right and faithful before the Lord his God.
In everything that he undertook in the service of Gods temple and in obedience to the law and the commands he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.
After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities thinking to conquer them for himself.
When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem
he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city and they helped him.
A large force of men assembled and they blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water? they said.
Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.
He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words
Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him for there is a greater power with us than with him.
With him is only the arm of flesh but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles. And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.
Later when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there
This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says On what are you basing your confidence that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
When Hezekiah says The Lord our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria he is misleading you to let you die of hunger and thirst.
Did not Hezekiah himself remove this gods high places and altars saying to Judah and Jerusalem You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it?
Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?
Who of all the gods of these nations that my fathers destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand?
Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!
Sennacheribs officers spoke further against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah.
The king also wrote letters insulting the Lord the God of Israel and saying this against him Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand.
Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city.
They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the worldthe work of mens hands.
King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.
And the Lord sent an angel who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god some of his sons cut him down with the sword.
So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them on every side.
Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.
In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the Lord who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem fiftyfive years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord following the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.
He built altars in the temple of the Lord of which the Lord had said My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.
In both courts of the temple of the Lord he built altars to all the starry hosts.
He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom practiced sorcery divination and witchcraft and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord provoking him to anger.
He took the carved image he had made and put it in Gods temple of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon In this temple and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel I will put my Name forever.
I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your forefathers if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws decrees and ordinances given through Moses.
But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray so that they did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites.
The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people but they paid no attention.
So the Lord brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria who took Manasseh prisoner put a hook in his nose bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.
In his distress he sought the favor of the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
And when he prayed to him the Lord was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God.
Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David west of the Gihon spring in the valley as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.
He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the Lord as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem and he threw them out of the city.
Then he restored the altar of the Lord and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it and told Judah to serve the Lord the God of Israel.
The people however continued to sacrifice at the high places but only to the Lord their God.
The other events of Manassehs reign including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the Lord the God of Israel are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.
His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himselfall are written in the records of the seers.
Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
Amon was twentytwo years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made.
But unlike his father Manasseh he did not humble himself before the Lord Amon increased his guilt.
Amons officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.
Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem thirtyone years.
He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and walked in the ways of his father David not turning aside to the right or to the left.
In the eighth year of his reign while he was still young he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places Asherah poles carved idols and cast images.
Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them and smashed the Asherah poles the idols and the images. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
He burned the bones of the priests on their altars and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem.
In the towns of Manasseh Ephraim and Simeon as far as Naphtali and in the ruins around them
he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
In the eighteenth year of Josiahs reign to purify the land and the temple he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city with Joah son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the temple of the Lord his God.
They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God which the Levites who were the doorkeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the Lords temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple.
They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
The men did the work faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah Levites descended from Merari and Zechariah and Meshullam descended from Kohath. The Levitesall who were skilled in playing musical instruments
had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries scribes and doorkeepers.
While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the Lord Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that had been given through Moses.
Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord. He gave it to Shaphan.
Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them.
They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers.
Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
When the king heard the words of the Law he tore his robes.
He gave these orders to Hilkiah Ahikam son of Shaphan Abdon son of Micah Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the kings attendant
Go and inquire of the Lord for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the Lords anger that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book.
Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophetess Huldah who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath the son of Hasrah keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second District.
She said to them This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Tell the man who sent you to me
This is what the Lord says I am going to bring disaster on this place and its peopleall the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.
Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all that their hands have made my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.
Tell the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord This is what the Lord the God of Israel says concerning the words you heard
Josiah celebrated the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.
He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the Lords temple.
He said to the Levites who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the Lord Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel.
Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions according to the directions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.
Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow countrymen the lay people.
Slaughter the Passover lambs consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow countrymen doing what the Lord commanded through Moses.
Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand sheep and goats for the Passover offerings and also three thousand cattleall from the kings own possessions.
His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah Zechariah and Jehiel the administrators of Gods temple gave the priests twentysix hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle.
Also Conaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers and Hashabiah Jeiel and Jozabad the leaders of the Levites provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.
The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered.
The Passover lambs were slaughtered and the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them while the Levites skinned the animals.
They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the Lord as is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.
They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed and boiled the holy offerings in pots caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people.
After this they made preparations for themselves and for the priests because the priests the descendants of Aaron were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.
The musicians the descendants of Asaph were in the places prescribed by David Asaph Heman and Jeduthun the kings seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.
So at that time the entire service of the Lord was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord as King Josiah had ordered.
The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah with the priests the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem.
This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiahs reign.
After all this when Josiah had set the temple in order Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle.
But Neco sent messengers to him saying What quarrel is there between you and me O king of Judah? It is not you I am attacking at this time but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry so stop opposing God who is with me or he will destroy you.
Josiah however would not turn away from him but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Neco had said at Gods command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.
And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
Jehoahaz was twentythree years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
The king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
The king of Egypt made Eliakim a brother of Jehoahaz king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakims name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Eliakims brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt.
Jehoiakim was twentyfive years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God.
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon articles from the temple of the Lord and put them in his temple there.
The other events of Jehoiakims reign the detestable things he did and all that was found against him are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. He did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
In the spring King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon together with articles of value from the temple of the Lord and he made Jehoiachins uncle Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing
This is what Cyrus king of Persia says The Lord the God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.
Anyone of his people among youmay his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the Lord the God of Israel the God who is in Jerusalem.
And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold with goods and livestock and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.
Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and Leviteseveryone whose heart God had movedprepared to go up and build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem.
All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold with goods and livestock and with valuable gifts in addition to all the freewill offerings.
Moreover King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.
Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
This was the inventory gold dishes 30 silver dishes 1000 silver pans 29
gold bowls 30 matching silver bowls 410 other articles 1000
In all there were 5400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along when the exiles came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive to Babylon (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah each to his own town

When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem.
Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it in accordance with what is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
Despite their fear of the peoples around them they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the Lord both the morning and evening sacrifices.
Then in accordance with what is written they celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day.
After that they presented the regular burnt offerings the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the Lord as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the Lord.
On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord though the foundation of the Lords temple had not yet been laid.
Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters and gave food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.
In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers  began the work appointing Levites twenty years of age and older to supervise the building of the house of the Lord.
Jeshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons  and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothersall Levitesjoined together in supervising those working on the house of God.
When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord the priests in their vestments and with trumpets and the Levites  with cymbals took their places to praise the Lord as prescribed by David king of Israel.
With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the Lord He is good his love to Israel endures forever. And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads who had seen the former temple wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid while many others shouted for joy.
No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.
When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the Lord the God of Israel
they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said Let us help you build because like you we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria who brought us here.
But Zerubbabel Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the Lord the God of Israel as King Cyrus the king of Persia commanded us.
Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.
They hired counselors to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia Bishlam Mithredath Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language.
Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows
Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary together with the rest of their associatesthe judges and officials over the men from Tripolis Persia Erech and Babylon the Elamites of Susa
and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in TransEuphrates.
To King Artaxerxes From your servants the men of TransEuphrates
The king should know that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.
Furthermore the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored no more taxes tribute or duty will be paid and the royal revenues will suffer.
Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored we are sending this message to inform the king
so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city troublesome to kings and provinces a place of rebellion from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.
We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored you will be left with nothing in TransEuphrates.
Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet a descendant of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them helping them.
At that time Tattenai governor of TransEuphrates and ShetharBozenai and their associates went to them and asked Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?
They also asked What are the names of the men constructing this building?
But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.
This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai governor of TransEuphrates and ShetharBozenai and their associates the officials of TransEuphrates sent to King Darius.
The report they sent him read as follows To King Darius Cordial greetings.
The king should know that we went to the district of Judah to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction.
We questioned the elders and asked them Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?
We also asked them their names so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
This is the answer they gave us We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago one that a great king of Israel built and finished.
But because our fathers angered the God of heaven he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean king of Babylon who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
However in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon. Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar whom he had appointed governor
and he told him Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.
So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished.
Now if it pleases the king let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.
King Darius then issued an order and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon.
A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media and this was written on it Memorandum
In the first year of King Cyrus the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices and let its foundations be laid. It is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide
with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury.
Also the gold and silver articles of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem they are to be deposited in the house of God.
so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the wellbeing of the king and his sons.
Furthermore I decree that if anyone changes this edict a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. And for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble.
May God who has caused his Name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.
Then because of the decree King Darius had sent Tattenai governor of TransEuphrates and ShetharBozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence.
So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus Darius and Artaxerxes kings of Persia.
The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
Then the people of Israelthe priests the Levites and the rest of the exilescelebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls two hundred rams four hundred male lambs and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats one for each of the tribes of Israel.
And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem according to what is written in the Book of Moses.
On the fourteenth day of the first month the exiles celebrated the Passover.
The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles for their brothers the priests and for themselves.
So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the Lord the God of Israel.
For seven days they celebrated with joy the Feast of Unleavened Bread because the Lord had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God the God of Israel.
After these things during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia Ezra son of Seraiah the son of Azariah the son of Hilkiah
the son of Shallum the son of Zadok the son of Ahitub
the son of Amariah the son of Azariah the son of Meraioth
the son of Zerahiah the son of Uzzi the son of Bukki
the son of Abishua the son of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the chief priest
this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses which the Lord the God of Israel had given. The king had granted him everything he asked for the hand of the Lord his God was on him.
Some of the Israelites including priests Levites singers gatekeepers and temple servants also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month for the gracious hand of his God was on him.
For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the Lord and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.
This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest and teacher a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the Lord for Israel
Artaxerxes king of kings To Ezra the priest a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven Greetings.
Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom including priests and Levites who wish to go to Jerusalem with you may go.
You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God which is in your hand.
Moreover you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel whose dwelling is in Jerusalem
together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem.
With this money be sure to buy bulls rams and male lambs together with their grain offerings and drink offerings and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
You and your brother Jews may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold in accordance with the will of your God.
Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God.
And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you may have occasion to supply you may provide from the royal treasury.
Now I King Artaxerxes order all the treasurers of TransEuphrates to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven may ask of you
up to a hundred talents of silver a hundred cors of wheat a hundred baths of wine a hundred baths of olive oil and salt without limit.
Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and of his sons?
You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes tribute or duty on any of the priests Levites singers gatekeepers temple servants or other workers at this house of God.
And you Ezra in accordance with the wisdom of your God which you possess appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of TransEuphratesall who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them.
Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death banishment confiscation of property or imprisonment.
Praise be to the Lord the God of our fathers who has put it into the kings heart to bring honor to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in this way
and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the kings powerful officials. Because the hand of the Lord my God was on me I took courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.
These are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes
of the descendants of Phinehas Gershom of the descendants of Ithamar Daniel of the descendants of David Hattush
of the descendants of Shecaniah of the descendants of Parosh Zechariah and with him were registered 150 men
of the descendants of PahathMoab Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah and with him 200 men
of the descendants of Zattu Shecaniah son of Jahaziel and with him 300 men
of the descendants of Adin Ebed son of Jonathan and with him 50 men
of the descendants of Elam Jeshaiah son of Athaliah and with him 70 men
of the descendants of Shephatiah Zebadiah son of Michael and with him 80 men
of the descendants of Joab Obadiah son of Jehiel and with him 218 men
of the descendants of Bani Shelomith son of Josiphiah and with him 160 men
of the descendants of Bebai Zechariah son of Bebai and with him 28 men
of the descendants of Azgad Johanan son of Hakkatan and with him 110 men
of the descendants of Adonikam the last ones whose names were Eliphelet Jeuel and Shemaiah and with them 60 men
of the descendants of Bigvai Uthai and Zaccur and with them 70 men.
After these things had been done the leaders came to me and said The people of Israel including the priests and the Levites have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices like those of the Canaanites Hittites Perizzites Jebusites Ammonites Moabites Egyptians and Amorites.
They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness.
When I heard this I tore my tunic and cloak pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.
Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
Then at the evening sacrifice I rose from my selfabasement with my tunic and cloak torn and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God
and prayed O my God I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you my God because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.
From the days of our forefathers until now our guilt has been great. Because of our sins we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings as it is today.
But now for a brief moment the Lord our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.
Though we are slaves our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
But now O our God what can we say after this? For we have disregarded the commands
you gave through your servants the prophets when you said The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.
Therefore do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.
What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt and yet our God you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.
Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us leaving us no remnant or survivor?
O Lord God of Israel you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.
While Ezra was praying and confessing weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God a large crowd of Israelitesmen women and childrengathered around him. They too wept bitterly.
Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel one of the descendants of Elam said to Ezra We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this there is still hope for Israel.
Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.
Rise up this matter is in your hands. We will support you so take courage and do it.
So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.
Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there he ate no food and drank no water because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.
Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
Within the three days all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.
Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them You have been unfaithful you have married foreign women adding to Israels guilt.
The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year while I was in the citadel of Susa
Hanani one of my brothers came from Judah with some other men and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile and also about Jerusalem.
They said to me Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire.
When I heard these things I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.
Then I said O Lord God of heaven the great and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands
let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites including myself and my fathers house have committed against you.
We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.
Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses saying If you are unfaithful I will scatter you among the nations
but if you return to me and obey my commands then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.
They are your servants and your people whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.
O Lord let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man. I was cupbearer to the king.
In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes when wine was brought for him I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before
so the king asked me Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart. I was very much afraid
but I said to the king May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire?
The king said to me What is it you want? Then I prayed to the God of heaven
and I answered the king If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it.
Then the king with the queen sitting beside him asked me How long will your journey take and when will you get back? It pleased the king to send me so I set a time.
I also said to him If it pleases the king may I have letters to the governors of TransEuphrates so that they will provide me safeconduct until I arrive in Judah?
And may I have a letter to Asaph keeper of the kings forest so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy? And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me the king granted my requests.
So I went to the governors of TransEuphrates and gave them the kings letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.
I went to Jerusalem and after staying there three days
I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.
By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate examining the walls of Jerusalem which had been broken down and its gates which had been destroyed by fire.
Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the Kings Pool but there was not enough room for my mount to get through
so I went up the valley by night examining the wall. Finally I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.
The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.
Then I said to them You see the trouble we are in Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned with fire. Come let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem and we will no longer be in disgrace.
I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They replied Let us start rebuilding. So they began this good work.
But when Sanballat the Horonite Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it they mocked and ridiculed us. What is this you are doing? they asked. Are you rebelling against the king?
I answered them by saying The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding but as for you you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it.
Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place building as far as the Tower of the Hundred which they dedicated and as far as the Tower of Hananel.
The men of Jericho built the adjoining section and Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.
The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and put its doors and bolts and bars in place.

When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews
and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria he said What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubbleburned as they are?
Tobiah the Ammonite who was at his side said What they are buildingif even a fox climbed up on it he would break down their wall of stones!
Hear us O our God for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.
Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders.
So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height for the people worked with all their heart.
But when Sanballat Tobiah the Arabs the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalems walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed they were very angry.
They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.
But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.
Meanwhile the people in Judah said The strength of the laborers is giving out and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.
Also our enemies said Before they know it or see us we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.
Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over Wherever you turn they will attack us.
Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places posting them by families with their swords spears and bows.
After I looked things over I stood up and said to the nobles the officials and the rest of the people Dont be afraid of them. Remember the Lord who is great and awesome and fight for your brothers your sons and your daughters your wives and your homes.
When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it we all returned to the wall each to his own work.
From that day on half of my men did the work while the other half were equipped with spears shields bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah
who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other
and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.
Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their Jewish brothers.
Some were saying We and our sons and daughters are numerous in order for us to eat and stay alive we must get grain.
Others were saying We are mortgaging our fields our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine.
Still others were saying We have had to borrow money to pay the kings tax on our fields and vineyards.
Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved but we are powerless because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.
When I heard their outcry and these charges I was very angry.
I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them You are exacting usury from your own countrymen! So I called together a large meeting to deal with them
and said As far as possible we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your brothers only for them to be sold back to us! They kept quiet because they could find nothing to say.
So I continued What you are doing is not right. Shouldnt you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?
I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let the exacting of usury stop!
Give back to them immediately their fields vineyards olive groves and houses and also the usury you are charging themthe hundredth part of the money grain new wine and oil.
We will give it back they said. And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say. Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.
I also shook out the folds of my robe and said In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied! At this the whole assembly said Amen and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised.
Moreover from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah until his thirtysecond yeartwelve yearsneither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
But the earlier governorsthose preceding meplaced a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.
Instead I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work we did not acquire any land.
Furthermore a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.
Each day one ox six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this I never demanded the food allotted to the governor because the demands were heavy on these people.
Remember me with favor O my God for all I have done for these people.
When word came to Sanballat Tobiah Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in itthough up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates
Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message Come let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono. But they were scheming to harm me
so I sent messengers to them with this reply I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?
Four times they sent me the same message and each time I gave them the same answer.
Then the fifth time Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message and in his hand was an unsealed letter
in which was written It is reported among the nationsand Geshem says it is truethat you and the Jews are plotting to revolt and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover according to these reports you are about to become their king
and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem There is a king in Judah! Now this report will get back to the king so come let us confer together.
I sent him this reply Nothing like what you are saying is happening you are just making it up out of your head.
They were all trying to frighten us thinking Their hands will get too weak for the work and it will not be completed. But I prayed Now strengthen my hands.
One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel who was shut in at his home. He said Let us meet in the house of God inside the temple and let us close the temple doors because men are coming to kill youby night they are coming to kill you.
But I said Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!
I realized that God had not sent him but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.
Remember Tobiah and Sanballat O my God because of what they have done remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.
So the wall was completed on the twentyfifth of Elul in fiftytwo days.
When all our enemies heard about this all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their selfconfidence because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.
Also in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.
For many in Judah were under oath to him since he was soninlaw to Shecaniah son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.
Moreover they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.
I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most men do.
I said to them The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards some at their posts and some near their own houses.
Now the city was large and spacious but there were few people in it and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there
These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah each to his own town
in company with Zerubbabel Jeshua Nehemiah Azariah Raamiah Nahamani Mordecai Bilshan Mispereth Bigvai Nehum and Baanah) The list of the men of Israel

all the people assembled as one man in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses which the Lord had commanded for Israel.
So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand.
He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.
Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah Shema Anaiah Uriah Hilkiah and Maaseiah and on his left were Pedaiah Mishael Malkijah Hashum Hashbaddanah Zechariah and Meshullam.
Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them and as he opened it the people all stood up.
Ezra praised the Lord the great God and all the people lifted their hands and responded Amen! Amen! Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.
The LevitesJeshua Bani Sherebiah Jamin Akkub Shabbethai Hodiah Maaseiah Kelita Azariah Jozabad Hanan and Pelaiahinstructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there.
They read from the Book of the Law of God making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was being read.
Then Nehemiah the governor Ezra the priest and scribe and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all This day is sacred to the Lord your God. Do not mourn or weep. For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.
Nehemiah said Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve for the joy of the Lord is your strength.
The Levites calmed all the people saying Be still for this is a sacred day. Do not grieve.
Then all the people went away to eat and drink to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.
On the second day of the month the heads of all the families along with the priests and the Levites gathered around Ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the Law.
They found written in the Law which the Lord had commanded through Moses that the Israelites were to live in booths during the feast of the seventh month
and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees and from myrtles palms and shade trees to make boothsas it is written.
So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves booths on their own roofs in their courtyards in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim.
The whole company that had returned from exile built booths and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great.
Day after day from the first day to the last Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the feast for seven days and on the eighth day in accordance with the regulation there was an assembly.
On the twentyfourth day of the same month the Israelites gathered together fasting and wearing sackcloth and having dust on their heads.
Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers.
They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a quarter of the day and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the Lord their God.
Standing on the stairs were the LevitesJeshua Bani Kadmiel Shebaniah Bunni Sherebiah Bani and Kenaniwho called with loud voices to the Lord their God.
And the LevitesJeshua Kadmiel Bani Hashabneiah Sherebiah Hodiah Shebaniah and Pethahiahsaid Stand up and praise the Lord your God who is from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
You alone are the Lord. You made the heavens even the highest heavens and all their starry host the earth and all that is on it the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything and the multitudes of heaven worship you.
You are the Lord God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham.
You found his heart faithful to you and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites Hittites Amorites Perizzites Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous.
You saw the suffering of our forefathers in Egypt you heard their cry at the Red Sea.
You sent miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh against all his officials and all the people of his land for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself which remains to this day.
You divided the sea before them so that they passed through it on dry ground but you hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone into mighty waters.
By day you led them with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take.
You came down on Mount Sinai you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right and decrees and commands that are good.
You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands decrees and laws through your servant Moses.
In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them.
But they our forefathers became arrogant and stiffnecked and did not obey your commands.
They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiffnecked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them
even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said This is your god who brought you up out of Egypt or when they committed awful blasphemies.
Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. By day the pillar of cloud did not cease to guide them on their path nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take.
You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths and you gave them water for their thirst.
For forty years you sustained them in the desert they lacked nothing their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen.
You gave them kingdoms and nations allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan.
You made their sons as numerous as the stars in the sky and you brought them into the land that you told their fathers to enter and possess.
Their sons went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites who lived in the land you handed the Canaanites over to them along with their kings and the peoples of the land to deal with them as they pleased.
They captured fortified cities and fertile land they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things wells already dug vineyards olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were wellnourished they reveled in your great goodness.
But they were disobedient and rebelled against you they put your law behind their backs. They killed your prophets who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you they committed awful blasphemies.
So you handed them over to their enemies who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.
But as soon as they were at rest they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again you heard from heaven and in your compassion you delivered them time after time.
You warned them to return to your law but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you became stiffnecked and refused to listen.
For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you admonished them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples.
But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them for you are a gracious and merciful God.
Now therefore O our God the great mighty and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyesthe hardship that has come upon us upon our kings and leaders upon our priests and prophets upon our fathers and all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
In all that has happened to us you have been just you have acted faithfully while we did wrong.
Our kings our leaders our priests and our fathers did not follow your law they did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them.
Even while they were in their kingdom enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.
But see we are slaves today slaves in the land you gave our forefathers so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces.
Because of our sins its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.
In view of all this we are making a binding agreement putting it in writing and our leaders our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it.
Those who sealed it were Nehemiah the governor the son of Hacaliah. Zedekiah
Seraiah Azariah Jeremiah

The rest of the peoplepriests Levites gatekeepers singers temple servants and all who separated themselves from the neighboring peoples for the sake of the Law of God together with their wives and all their sons and daughters who are able to understand
all these now join their brothers the nobles and bind themselves with a curse and an oath to follow the Law of God given through Moses the servant of God and to obey carefully all the commands regulations and decrees of the Lord our Lord.
We promise not to give our daughters in marriage to the peoples around us or take their daughters for our sons.
When the neighboring peoples bring merchandise or grain to sell on the Sabbath we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on any holy day. Every seventh year we will forgo working the land and will cancel all debts.
We assume the responsibility for carrying out the commands to give a third of a shekel each year for the service of the house of our God
for the bread set out on the table for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings for the offerings on the Sabbaths New Moon festivals and appointed feasts for the holy offerings for sin offerings to make atonement for Israel and for all the duties of the house of our God.
Wethe priests the Levites and the peoplehave cast lots to determine when each of our families is to bring to the house of our God at set times each year a contribution of wood to burn on the altar of the Lord our God as it is written in the Law.
We also assume responsibility for bringing to the house of the Lord each year the firstfruits of our crops and of every fruit tree.
Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem the holy city while the remaining nine were to stay in their own towns.
The people commended all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem (now some Israelites priests Levites temple servants and descendants of Solomons servants lived in the towns of Judah each on his own property in the various towns

The rest of the Israelites with the priests and Levites were in all the towns of Judah each on his ancestral property.
The temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of them.
The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani the son of Hashabiah the son of Mattaniah the son of Mica. Uzzi was one of Asaphs descendants who were the singers responsible for the service of the house of God.
The singers were under the kings orders which regulated their daily activity.
Pethahiah son of Meshezabel one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah was the kings agent in all affairs relating to the people.

in Anathoth Nob and Ananiah
in Hazor Ramah and Gittaim
in Hadid Zeboim and Neballat

Bakbukiah and Unni their associates stood opposite them in the services.
Jeshua was the father of Joiakim Joiakim the father of Eliashib Eliashib the father of Joiada

The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib Joiada Johanan and Jaddua as well as those of the priests were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian.
The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the book of the annals.
And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah Sherebiah Jeshua son of Kadmiel and their associates who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving one section responding to the other as prescribed by David the man of God.
Mattaniah Bakbukiah Obadiah Meshullam Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals harps and lyres.
The singers also were brought together from the region around Jerusalemfrom the villages of the Netophathites
from Beth Gilgal and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially they purified the people the gates and the wall.
On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God
because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them.
When the people heard this law they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent.
Before this Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah
and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles and also the tithes of grain new wine and oil prescribed for the Levites singers and gatekeepers as well as the contributions for the priests.
But while all this was going on I was not in Jerusalem for in the thirtysecond year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission
and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God.
I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiahs household goods out of the room.
I gave orders to purify the rooms and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God with the grain offerings and the incense.
I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them and that all the Levites and singers responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields.
So I rebuked the officials and asked them Why is the house of God neglected? Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts.
All Judah brought the tithes of grain new wine and oil into the storerooms.
I put Shelemiah the priest Zadok the scribe and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah their assistant because these men were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their brothers.
Remember me for this O my God and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services.
In those days I saw men in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys together with wine grapes figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day.
Men from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah.
I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them What is this wicked thing you are doingdesecrating the Sabbath day?
Didnt your forefathers do the same things so that our God brought all this calamity upon us and upon this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.
When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day.
Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem.
But I warned them and said Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again I will lay hands on you. From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath.
This is what happened during the time of Xerxes the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush
At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa
and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media the princes and the nobles of the provinces were present.
For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.
When these days were over the king gave a banquet lasting seven days in the enclosed garden of the kings palace for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa.
The garden had hangings of white and blue linen fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry marble motherofpearl and other costly stones.
Wine was served in goblets of gold each one different from the other and the royal wine was abundant in keeping with the kings liberality.
By the kings command each guest was allowed to drink in his own way for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.
Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
On the seventh day when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine he commanded the seven eunuchs who served himMehuman Biztha Harbona Bigtha Abagtha Zethar and Carcas
to bring before him Queen Vashti wearing her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles for she was lovely to look at.
But when the attendants delivered the kings command Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.
Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice he spoke with the wise men who understood the times
and were closest to the kingCarshena Shethar Admatha Tarshish Meres Marsena and Memucan the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
According to law what must be done to Queen Vashti? he asked. She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her.
Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles Queen Vashti has done wrong not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.
For the queens conduct will become known to all the women and so they will despise their husbands and say King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him but she would not come.
This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queens conduct will respond to all the kings nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.
Therefore if it pleases the king let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media which cannot be repealed that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.
Then when the kings edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm all the women will respect their husbands from the least to the greatest.
The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice so the king did as Memucan proposed.
He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language proclaiming in each peoples tongue that every man should be ruler over his own household.
Later when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her.
Then the kings personal attendants proposed Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.
Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai the kings eunuch who is in charge of the women and let beauty treatments be given to them.
Then let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. This advice appealed to the king and he followed it.
Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish
who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon among those taken captive with Jehoiachin king of Judah.
Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This girl who was also known as Esther was lovely in form and features and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.
When the kings order and edict had been proclaimed many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the kings palace and entrusted to Hegai who had charge of the harem.
The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven maids selected from the kings palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.
Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.
Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
Before a girls turn came to go in to King Xerxes she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.
And this is how she would go to the king Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the kings palace.
In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz the kings eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.
After these events King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles.
All the royal officials at the kings gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.
Then the royal officials at the kings gate asked Mordecai Why do you disobey the kings command?
Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecais behavior would be tolerated for he had told them he was a Jew.
When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor he was enraged.
Yet having learned who Mordecais people were he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecais people the Jews throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.
In the twelfth year of King Xerxes in the first month the month of Nisan they cast the pur  in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month the month of Adar.
Then Haman said to King Xerxes There is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the kings laws it is not in the kings best interest to tolerate them.
If it pleases the king let a decree be issued to destroy them and I will put ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for the men who carry out this business.
So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite the enemy of the Jews.
Keep the money the king said to Haman and do with the people as you please.
Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Hamans orders to the kings satraps the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.
Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the kings provinces with the order to destroy kill and annihilate all the Jewsyoung and old women and little childrenon a single day the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of Adar and to plunder their goods.
A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.
Spurred on by the kings command the couriers went out and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink but the city of Susa was bewildered.
When Mordecai learned of all that had been done he tore his clothes put on sackcloth and ashes and went out into the city wailing loudly and bitterly.
But he went only as far as the kings gate because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it.
In every province to which the edict and order of the king came there was great mourning among the Jews with fasting weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
When Esthers maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth but he would not accept them.
Then Esther summoned Hathach one of the kings eunuchs assigned to attend her and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.
So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the kings gate.
Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation which had been published in Susa to show to Esther and explain it to her and he told him to urge her to go into the kings presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.
Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.
Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai
All the kings officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law that he be put to death. The only exception to this is for the king to extend the gold scepter to him and spare his life. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king.
When Esthers words were reported to Mordecai
he sent back this answer Do not think that because you are in the kings house you alone of all the Jews will escape.
On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace in front of the kings hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall facing the entrance.
When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
Then the king asked What is it Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom it will be given you.
If it pleases the king replied Esther let the king together with Haman come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.
Bring Haman at once the king said so that we may do what Esther asks. So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.
As they were drinking wine the king again asked Esther Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom it will be granted.
Esther replied My petition and my request is this
If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the kings question.
Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the kings gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence he was filled with rage against Mordecai.
Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. Calling together his friends and Zeresh his wife
Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth his many sons and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials.
And thats not all Haman added. Im the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow.
But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the kings gate.
His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him Have a gallows built seventyfive feet high and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go with the king to the dinner and be happy. This suggestion delighted Haman and he had the gallows built.
That night the king could not sleep so he ordered the book of the chronicles the record of his reign to be brought in and read to him.
It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh two of the kings officers who guarded the doorway who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this? the king asked. Nothing has been done for him his attendants answered.
The king said Who is in the court? Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had erected for him.
His attendants answered Haman is standing in the court. Bring him in the king ordered.
When Haman entered the king asked him What should be done for the man the king delights to honor? Now Haman thought to himself Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?
So he answered the king For the man the king delights to honor
have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden one with a royal crest placed on its head.
Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the kings most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor and lead him on the horse through the city streets proclaiming before him This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor! 
So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther
and as they were drinking wine on that second day the king again asked Queen Esther what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom it will be granted.
Then Queen Esther answered If I have found favor with you O king and if it pleases your majesty grant me my lifethis is my petition. And spare my peoplethis is my request.
For I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves I would have kept quiet because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.
King Xerxes asked Queen Esther Who is he? Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?
Esther said The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman. Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.
The king got up in a rage left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman realizing that the king had already decided his fate stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.
Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house? As soon as the word left the kings mouth they covered Hamans face.
Then Harbona one of the eunuchs attending the king said A gallows seventyfive feet high stands by Hamans house. He had it made for Mordecai who spoke up to help the king. The king said Hang him on it!
So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the kings fury subsided.
That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king for Esther had told how he was related to her.
The king took off his signet ring which he had reclaimed from Haman and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Hamans estate.
Esther again pleaded with the king falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite which he had devised against the Jews.
Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.
If it pleases the king she said and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do and if he is pleased with me let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the kings provinces.
For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?
The kings edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves to destroy kill and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them and their women and children and to plunder the property of their enemies.
The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of Adar.
A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
The couriers riding the royal horses raced out spurred on by the kings command. And the edict was also issued in the citadel of Susa.
Mordecai left the kings presence wearing royal garments of blue and white a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration.
For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy gladness and honor.
In every province and in every city wherever the edict of the king went there was joy and gladness among the Jews with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.
On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of Adar the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them.
The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those seeking their destruction. No one could stand against them because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them.
King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire to its distant shores.
And all his acts of power and might together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king had raised him are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia?
Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes preeminent among the Jews and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.
In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright he feared God and shunned evil.
He had seven sons and three daughters
and he owned seven thousand sheep three thousand camels five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
When a period of feasting had run its course Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them thinking Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. This was Jobs regular custom.
One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan also came with them.
The Lord said to Satan Where have you come from? Satan answered the Lord From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.
Then the Lord said to Satan Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears God and shuns evil.
Does Job fear God for nothing? Satan replied.
Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your face.
The Lord said to Satan Very well then everything he has is in your hands but on the man himself do not lay a finger. Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.
On another day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
And the Lord said to Satan Where have you come from? Satan answered the Lord From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.
Then the Lord said to Satan Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.
Skin for skin! Satan replied. A man will give all he has for his own life.
But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones and he will surely curse you to your face.
The Lord said to Satan Very well then he is in your hands but you must spare his life.
So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
His wife said to him Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!
He replied You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God and not trouble? In all this Job did not sin in what he said.
When Jobs three friends Eliphaz the Temanite Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite heard about all the troubles that had come upon him they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
When they saw him from a distance they could hardly recognize him they began to weep aloud and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw how great his suffering was.
After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
He said
May the day of my birth perish and the night it was said A boy is born!
That daymay it turn to darkness may God above not care about it may no light shine upon it.
May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more may a cloud settle over it may blackness overwhelm its light.
That nightmay thick darkness seize it may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
May that night be barren may no shout of joy be heard in it.
May those who curse days curse that day those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
May its morning stars become dark may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn
for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.
Why did I not perish at birth and die as I came from the womb?
Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
For now I would be lying down in peace I would be asleep and at rest
with kings and counselors of the earth who built for themselves places now lying in ruins
with rulers who had gold who filled their houses with silver.
Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child like an infant who never saw the light of day?
There the wicked cease from turmoil and there the weary are at rest.
Captives also enjoy their ease they no longer hear the slave drivers shout.
The small and the great are there and the slave is freed from his master.
Why is light given to those in misery and life to the bitter of soul
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied
If someone ventures a word with you will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?
Think how you have instructed many how you have strengthened feeble hands.
Your words have supported those who stumbled you have strengthened faltering knees.
But now trouble comes to you and you are discouraged it strikes you and you are dismayed.
Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?
Consider now Who being innocent has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?
As I have observed those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
At the breath of God they are destroyed at the blast of his anger they perish.
The lions may roar and growl yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
The lion perishes for lack of prey and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
A word was secretly brought to me my ears caught a whisper of it.
Amid disquieting dreams in the night when deep sleep falls on men
fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
A spirit glided past my face and the hair on my body stood on end.
It stopped but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes and I heard a hushed voice
Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
If God places no trust in his servants if he charges his angels with error
how much more those who live in houses of clay whose foundations are in the dust who are crushed more readily than a moth!
Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces unnoticed they perish forever.
Are not the cords of their tent pulled up so that they die without wisdom?
Call if you will but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
Resentment kills a fool and envy slays the simple.
I myself have seen a fool taking root but suddenly his house was cursed.
His children are far from safety crushed in court without a defender.
The hungry consume his harvest taking it even from among thorns and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
For hardship does not spring from the soil nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
But if it were I I would appeal to God I would lay my cause before him.
He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed miracles that cannot be counted.
He bestows rain on the earth he sends water upon the countryside.
The lowly he sets on high and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
He thwarts the plans of the crafty so that their hands achieve no success.
He catches the wise in their craftiness and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
Darkness comes upon them in the daytime at noon they grope as in the night.
He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
So the poor have hope and injustice shuts its mouth.
Blessed is the man whom God corrects so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
For he wounds but he also binds up he injures but his hands also heal.
From six calamities he will rescue you in seven no harm will befall you.
In famine he will ransom you from death and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
You will be protected from the lash of the tongue and need not fear when destruction comes.
You will laugh at destruction and famine and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
You will know that your tent is secure you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
You will know that your children will be many and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
You will come to the grave in full vigor like sheaves gathered in season.
We have examined this and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself.
Then Job replied
If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas no wonder my words have been impetuous.
The arrows of the Almighty are in me my spirit drinks in their poison Gods terrors are marshaled against me.
Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
Is tasteless food eaten without salt or is there flavor in the white of an egg?
I refuse to touch it such food makes me ill.
Oh that I might have my request that God would grant what I hope for
that God would be willing to crush me to let loose his hand and cut me off!
Then I would still have this consolation my joy in unrelenting pain that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
What strength do I have that I should still hope? What prospects that I should be patient?
Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
Do I have any power to help myself now that success has been driven from me?
A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams as the streams that overflow
when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow
but that cease to flow in the dry season and in the heat vanish from their channels.
Caravans turn aside from their routes they go up into the wasteland and perish.
The caravans of Tema look for water the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
They are distressed because they had been confident they arrive there only to be disappointed.
Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?
Like a slave longing for the evening shadows or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages
so I have been allotted months of futility and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
When I lie down I think How long before I get up? The night drags on and I toss till dawn.
My body is clothed with worms and scabs my skin is broken and festering.
My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and they come to an end without hope.
Remember O God that my life is but a breath my eyes will never see happiness again.
The eye that now sees me will see me no longer you will look for me but I will be no more.
As a cloud vanishes and is gone so he who goes down to the grave does not return.
He will never come to his house again his place will know him no more.
Therefore I will not keep silent I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Am I the sea or the monster of the deep that you put me under guard?
When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint
even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions
so that I prefer strangling and death rather than this body of mine.
I despise my life I would not live forever. Let me alone my days have no meaning.
What is man that you make so much of him that you give him so much attention
that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?
Will you never look away from me or let me alone even for an instant?
If I have sinned what have I done to you O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?
Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust you will search for me but I will be no more.
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied
How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.
Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
When your children sinned against him he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty
if you are pure and upright even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.
Your beginnings will seem humble so prosperous will your future be.
Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned
for we were born only yesterday and know nothing and our days on earth are but a shadow.
Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
While still growing and uncut they wither more quickly than grass.
Such is the destiny of all who forget God so perishes the hope of the godless.
What he trusts in is fragile what he relies on is a spiders web.
He leans on his web but it gives way he clings to it but it does not hold.
He is like a wellwatered plant in the sunshine spreading its shoots over the garden
it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
But when it is torn from its spot that place disowns it and says I never saw you.
Surely its life withers away and from the soil other plants grow.
Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
Your enemies will be clothed in shame and the tents of the wicked will be no more.
Then Job replied
Indeed I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?
Though one wished to dispute with him he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
His wisdom is profound his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.
He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.
He speaks to the sun and it does not shine he seals off the light of the stars.
He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed miracles that cannot be counted.
When he passes me I cannot see him when he goes by I cannot perceive him.
If he snatches away who can stop him? Who can say to him What are you doing?
God does not restrain his anger even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
Though I were innocent I could not answer him I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
Even if I summoned him and he responded I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
If it is a matter of strength he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice who will summon him?
Even if I were innocent my mouth would condemn me if I were blameless it would pronounce me guilty.
Although I am blameless I have no concern for myself I despise my own life.
I loathe my very life therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
I will say to God Do not condemn me but tell me what charges you have against me.
Does it please you to oppress me to spurn the work of your hands while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?
Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?
Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man
that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin
though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?
Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?
Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?
Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese
clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?
You gave me life and showed me kindness and in your providence watched over my spirit.
But this is what you concealed in your heart and I know that this was in your mind
If I sinned you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.
If I am guiltywoe to me! Even if I am innocent I cannot lift my head for I am full of shame and drowned in my affliction.
If I hold my head high you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.
You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me your forces come against me wave upon wave.
Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.
If only I had never come into being or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!
Then Zophar the Naamathite replied
Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?
Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?
You say to God My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.
Oh how I wish that God would speak that he would open his lips against you
and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom for true wisdom has two sides. Know this God has even forgotten some of your sin.
Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
They are higher than the heavenswhat can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave what can you know?
Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court who can oppose him?
Surely he recognizes deceitful men and when he sees evil does he not take note?
But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkeys colt can be born a man.
Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him
if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent
then you will lift up your face without shame you will stand firm and without fear.
You will surely forget your trouble recalling it only as waters gone by.
Life will be brighter than noonday and darkness will become like morning.
You will be secure because there is hope you will look about you and take your rest in safety.
You will lie down with no one to make you afraid and many will court your favor.
But the eyes of the wicked will fail and escape will elude them their hope will become a dying gasp.
Then Job replied
Doubtless you are the people and wisdom will die with you!
But I have a mind as well as you I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?
I have become a laughingstock to my friends though I called upon God and he answered a mere laughingstock though righteous and blameless!
Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
The tents of marauders are undisturbed and those who provoke God are secure those who carry their god in their hands.
But ask the animals and they will teach you or the birds of the air and they will tell you
or speak to the earth and it will teach you or let the fish of the sea inform you.
Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?
In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.
Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?
Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?
To God belong wisdom and power counsel and understanding are his.
What he tears down cannot be rebuilt the man he imprisons cannot be released.
If he holds back the waters there is drought if he lets them loose they devastate the land.
To him belong strength and victory both deceived and deceiver are his.
He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.
He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.
He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.
He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.
He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.
He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.
He makes nations great and destroys them he enlarges nations and disperses them.
He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.
They grope in darkness with no light he makes them stagger like drunkards.
My eyes have seen all this my ears have heard and understood it.
What you know I also know I am not inferior to you.
But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.
You however smear me with lies you are worthless physicians all of you!
If only you would be altogether silent! For you that would be wisdom.
Hear now my argument listen to the plea of my lips.
Will you speak wickedly on Gods behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?
Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?
Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?
He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?
Your maxims are proverbs of ashes your defenses are defenses of clay.
Keep silent and let me speak then let come to me what may.
Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?
Though he slay me yet will I hope in him I will surely defend my ways to his face.
Indeed this will turn out for my deliverance for no godless man would dare come before him!
Listen carefully to my words let your ears take in what I say.
Now that I have prepared my case I know I will be vindicated.
Can anyone bring charges against me? If so I will be silent and die.
Only grant me these two things O God and then I will not hide from you
Withdraw your hand far from me and stop frightening me with your terrors.
Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.
He springs up like a flower and withers away like a fleeting shadow he does not endure.
Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him before you for judgment?
Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!
Mans days are determined you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.
So look away from him and let him alone till he has put in his time like a hired man.
At least there is hope for a tree If it is cut down it will sprout again and its new shoots will not fail.
Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil
yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.
But man dies and is laid low he breathes his last and is no more.
As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry
so man lies down and does not rise till the heavens are no more men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.
If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!
If a man dies will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.
You will call and I will answer you you will long for the creature your hands have made.
Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.
My offenses will be sealed up in a bag you will cover over my sin.
But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place
as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil so you destroy mans hope.
You overpower him once for all and he is gone you change his countenance and send him away.
If his sons are honored he does not know it if they are brought low he does not see it.
He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied
Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?
Would he argue with useless words with speeches that have no value?
But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.
Your sin prompts your mouth you adopt the tongue of the crafty.
Your own mouth condemns you not mine your own lips testify against you.
Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?
Do you listen in on Gods council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?
The grayhaired and the aged are on our side men even older than your father.
Are Gods consolations not enough for you words spoken gently to you?
Why has your heart carried you away and why do your eyes flash
so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?
What is man that he could be pure or one born of woman that he could be righteous?
If God places no trust in his holy ones if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes
how much less man who is vile and corrupt who drinks up evil like water!
Listen to me and I will explain to you let me tell you what I have seen
what wise men have declared hiding nothing received from their fathers

All his days the wicked man suffers torment the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.
Terrifying sounds fill his ears when all seems well marauders attack him.
Then Job replied
I have heard many things like these miserable comforters are you all!
Will your longwinded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?
I also could speak like you if you were in my place I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.
But my mouth would encourage you comfort from my lips would bring you relief.
Yet if I speak my pain is not relieved and if I refrain it does not go away.
Surely O God you have worn me out you have devastated my entire household.
You have bound meand it has become a witness my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.
God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.
Men open their mouths to jeer at me they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.
God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.
All was well with me but he shattered me he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target
his archers surround me. Without pity he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.
Again and again he bursts upon me he rushes at me like a warrior.
I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.
My spirit is broken my days are cut short the grave awaits me.
Surely mockers surround me my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
Give me O God the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?
You have closed their minds to understanding therefore you will not let them triumph.
If a man denounces his friends for reward the eyes of his children will fail.
God has made me a byword to everyone a man in whose face people spit.
My eyes have grown dim with grief my whole frame is but a shadow.
But come on all of you try again! I will not find a wise man among you.
My days have passed my plans are shattered and so are the desires of my heart.
These men turn night into day in the face of darkness they say Light is near.
If the only home I hope for is the grave if I spread out my bed in darkness
if I say to corruption You are my father and to the worm My mother or My sister
where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?
Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied
When will you end these speeches? Be sensible and then we can talk.
Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?
You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?
The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out the flame of his fire stops burning.
The light in his tent becomes dark the lamp beside him goes out.
The vigor of his step is weakened his own schemes throw him down.
His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh.
A trap seizes him by the heel a snare holds him fast.
A noose is hidden for him on the ground a trap lies in his path.
Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.
Calamity is hungry for him disaster is ready for him when he falls.
It eats away parts of his skin deaths firstborn devours his limbs.
He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.
Fire resides in his tent burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.
His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.
The memory of him perishes from the earth he has no name in the land.
He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.
He has no offspring or descendants among his people no survivor where once he lived.
Men of the west are appalled at his fate men of the east are seized with horror.
Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man such is the place of one who knows not God.
Then Job replied
How long will you torment me and crush me with words?
Ten times now you have reproached me shamelessly you attack me.
If it is true that I have gone astray my error remains my concern alone.
If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me
then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.
Though I cry Ive been wronged! I get no response though I call for help there is no justice.
He has blocked my way so I cannot pass he has shrouded my paths in darkness.
He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
He tears me down on every side till I am gone he uproots my hope like a tree.
His anger burns against me he counts me among his enemies.
His troops advance in force they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
He has alienated my brothers from me my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
My kinsmen have gone away my friends have forgotten me.
My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger they look upon me as an alien.
I summon my servant but he does not answer though I beg him with my own mouth.
My breath is offensive to my wife I am loathsome to my own brothers.
Even the little boys scorn me when I appear they ridicule me.
All my intimate friends detest me those I love have turned against me.
I am nothing but skin and bones I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.
Have pity on me my friends have pity for the hand of God has struck me.
Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
Oh that my words were recorded that they were written on a scroll
that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead or engraved in rock forever!
I know that my Redeemer lives and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.
And after my skin has been destroyed yet in my flesh I will see God
I myself will see him with my own eyesI and not another. How my heart yearns within me!
If you say How we will hound him since the root of the trouble lies in him
you should fear the sword yourselves for wrath will bring punishment by the sword and then you will know that there is judgment.
Then Zophar the Naamathite replied
My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.
I hear a rebuke that dishonors me and my understanding inspires me to reply.
Surely you know how it has been from of old ever since man was placed on the earth
that the mirth of the wicked is brief the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds
he will perish forever like his own dung those who have seen him will say Where is he?
Like a dream he flies away no more to be found banished like a vision of the night.
The eye that saw him will not see him again his place will look on him no more.
His children must make amends to the poor his own hands must give back his wealth.
The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.
Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue
though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth
yet his food will turn sour in his stomach it will become the venom of serpents within him.
He will spit out the riches he swallowed God will make his stomach vomit them up.
He will suck the poison of serpents the fangs of an adder will kill him.
He will not enjoy the streams the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
What he toiled for he must give back uneaten he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.
For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute he has seized houses he did not build.
Surely he will have no respite from his craving he cannot save himself by his treasure.
Nothing is left for him to devour his prosperity will not endure.
In the midst of his plenty distress will overtake him the full force of misery will come upon him.
He pulls it out of his back the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him
total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
The heavens will expose his guilt the earth will rise up against him.
A flood will carry off his house rushing waters on the day of Gods wrath.
Such is the fate God allots the wicked the heritage appointed for them by God.
Then Job replied
Listen carefully to my words let this be the consolation you give me.
Bear with me while I speak and after I have spoken mock on.
Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?
Look at me and be astonished clap your hand over your mouth.
When I think about this I am terrified trembling seizes my body.
Why do the wicked live on growing old and increasing in power?
They see their children established around them their offspring before their eyes.
Their homes are safe and free from fear the rod of God is not upon them.
Their bulls never fail to breed their cows calve and do not miscarry.
They send forth their children as a flock their little ones dance about.
They sing to the music of tambourine and harp they make merry to the sound of the flute.
They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.
Yet they say to God Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.
Who is the Almighty that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?
But their prosperity is not in their own hands so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.
Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them the fate God allots in his anger?
How often are they like straw before the wind like chaff swept away by a gale?
It is said God stores up a mans punishment for his sons. Let him repay the man himself so that he will know it!
Let his own eyes see his destruction let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
For what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end?
Can anyone teach knowledge to God since he judges even the highest?
One man dies in full vigor completely secure and at ease
his body well nourished his bones rich with marrow.
Another man dies in bitterness of soul never having enjoyed anything good.
Side by side they lie in the dust and worms cover them both.
I know full well what you are thinking the schemes by which you would wrong me.
You say Where now is the great mans house the tents where wicked men lived?
Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied
Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?
What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?
Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?
Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?
You demanded security from your brothers for no reason you stripped men of their clothing leaving them naked.
You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry
though you were a powerful man owning land an honored man living on it.
And you sent widows away emptyhanded and broke the strength of the fatherless.
That is why snares are all around you why sudden peril terrifies you
why it is so dark you cannot see and why a flood of water covers you.
Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!
Yet you say What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?
Thick clouds veil him so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.
Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?
They were carried off before their time their foundations washed away by a flood.
Then Job replied
Even today my complaint is bitter his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
If only I knew where to find him if only I could go to his dwelling!
I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
I would find out what he would answer me and consider what he would say.
Would he oppose me with great power? No he would not press charges against me.
There an upright man could present his case before him and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
But if I go to the east he is not there if I go to the west I do not find him.
When he is at work in the north I do not see him when he turns to the south I catch no glimpse of him.
But he knows the way that I take when he has tested me I will come forth as gold.
My feet have closely followed his steps I have kept to his way without turning aside.
I have not departed from the commands of his lips I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
But he stands alone and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.
He carries out his decree against me and many such plans he still has in store.
That is why I am terrified before him when I think of all this I fear him.
God has made my heart faint the Almighty has terrified me.
Yet I am not silenced by the darkness by the thick darkness that covers my face.
Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?
Men move boundary stones they pasture flocks they have stolen.
They drive away the orphans donkey and take the widows ox in pledge.
They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
Like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go about their labor of foraging food the wasteland provides food for their children.
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied
Dominion and awe belong to God he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?
How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes
how much less man who is but a maggot a son of man who is only a worm!
Then Job replied
How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!
What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!
Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?
The dead are in deep anguish those beneath the waters and all that live in them.
Death is naked before God Destruction lies uncovered.
He spreads out the northern skies over empty space he suspends the earth over nothing.
He wraps up the waters in his clouds yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.
He covers the face of the full moon spreading his clouds over it.
He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.
The pillars of the heavens quake aghast at his rebuke.
By his power he churned up the sea by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
By his breath the skies became fair his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
And these are but the outer fringe of his works how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?
And Job continued his discourse
As surely as God lives who has denied me justice the Almighty who has made me taste bitterness of soul
as long as I have life within me the breath of God in my nostrils
my lips will not speak wickedness and my tongue will utter no deceit.
I will never admit you are in the right till I die I will not deny my integrity.
I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.
May my enemies be like the wicked my adversaries like the unjust!
For what hope has the godless when he is cut off when God takes away his life?
Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him?
Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
I will teach you about the power of God the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.
You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?
Here is the fate God allots to the wicked the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty
However many his children their fate is the sword his offspring will never have enough to eat.
The plague will bury those who survive him and their widows will not weep for them.
Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay
what he lays up the righteous will wear and the innocent will divide his silver.
The house he builds is like a moths cocoon like a hut made by a watchman.
He lies down wealthy but will do so no more when he opens his eyes all is gone.
Terrors overtake him like a flood a tempest snatches him away in the night.
The east wind carries him off and he is gone it sweeps him out of his place.
It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.
It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.
There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
Iron is taken from the earth and copper is smelted from ore.
Man puts an end to the darkness he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.
Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man far from men he dangles and sways.
The earth from which food comes is transformed below as by fire
sapphires come from its rocks and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
No bird of prey knows that hidden path no falcons eye has seen it.
Proud beasts do not set foot on it and no lion prowls there.
Mans hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains.
He tunnels through the rock his eyes see all its treasures.
He searches the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light.
But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?
Man does not comprehend its worth it cannot be found in the land of the living.
The deep says It is not in me the sea says It is not with me.
It cannot be bought with the finest gold nor can its price be weighed in silver.
It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir with precious onyx or sapphires.
Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it it cannot be bought with pure gold.
Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?
It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing concealed even from the birds of the air.
Destruction and Death say Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.
God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells
for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
Job continued his discourse
How I long for the months gone by for the days when God watched over me
when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!
Oh for the days when I was in my prime when Gods intimate friendship blessed my house
when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me
when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.
When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square
the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet
the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands
the voices of the nobles were hushed and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
Whoever heard me spoke well of me and those who saw me commended me
because I rescued the poor who cried for help and the fatherless who had none to assist him.
The man who was dying blessed me I made the widows heart sing.
I put on righteousness as my clothing justice was my robe and my turban.
I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
I was a father to the needy I took up the case of the stranger.
I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.
I thought I will die in my own house my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
My roots will reach to the water and the dew will lie all night on my branches.
My glory will remain fresh in me the bow ever new in my hand.
Men listened to me expectantly waiting in silence for my counsel.
After I had spoken they spoke no more my words fell gently on their ears.
They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.
When I smiled at them they scarcely believed it the light of my face was precious to them.
I chose the way for them and sat as their chief I dwelt as a king among his troops I was like one who comforts mourners.
But now they mock me men younger than I whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.
Of what use was the strength of their hands to me since their vigor had gone from them?
Haggard from want and hunger they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.
In the brush they gathered salt herbs and their food was the root of the broom tree.
They were banished from their fellow men shouted at as if they were thieves.
They were forced to live in the dry stream beds among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.
A base and nameless brood they were driven out of the land.
And now their sons mock me in song I have become a byword among them.
They detest me and keep their distance they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me they throw off restraint in my presence.
On my right the tribe attacks they lay snares for my feet they build their siege ramps against me.
They break up my road they succeed in destroying me without anyones helping them.
They advance as through a gaping breach amid the ruins they come rolling in.
Terrors overwhelm me my dignity is driven away as by the wind my safety vanishes like a cloud.
And now my life ebbs away days of suffering grip me.
Night pierces my bones my gnawing pains never rest.
In his great power God becomes like clothing to me he binds me like the neck of my garment.
He throws me into the mud and I am reduced to dust and ashes.
I cry out to you O God but you do not answer I stand up but you merely look at me.
You turn on me ruthlessly with the might of your hand you attack me.
You snatch me up and drive me before the wind you toss me about in the storm.
I know you will bring me down to death to the place appointed for all the living.
Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.
Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
Yet when I hoped for good evil came when I looked for light then came darkness.
The churning inside me never stops days of suffering confront me.
I go about blackened but not by the sun I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
I have become a brother of jackals a companion of owls.
My skin grows black and peels my body burns with fever.
My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of wailing.
I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.
For what is mans lot from God above his heritage from the Almighty on high?
Is it not ruin for the wicked disaster for those who do wrong?
Does he not see my ways and count my every step?
If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit
let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless
if my steps have turned from the path if my heart has been led by my eyes or if my hands have been defiled
then may others eat what I have sown and may my crops be uprooted.
If my heart has been enticed by a woman or if I have lurked at my neighbors door
then may my wife grind another mans grain and may other men sleep with her.
For that would have been shameful a sin to be judged.
It is a fire that burns to Destruction it would have uprooted my harvest.
If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me
what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?
Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?
If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary
if I have kept my bread to myself not sharing it with the fatherless
but from my youth I reared him as would a father and from my birth I guided the widow
if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing or a needy man without a garment
and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep
if I have raised my hand against the fatherless knowing that I had influence in court
So these three men stopped answering Job because he was righteous in his own eyes.
But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite of the family of Ram became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
He was also angry with the three friends because they had found no way to refute Job and yet had condemned him.
Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say his anger was aroused.
So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said I am young in years and you are old that is why I was fearful not daring to tell you what I know.
I thought Age should speak advanced years should teach wisdom.
But it is the spirit in a man the breath of the Almighty that gives him understanding.
It is not only the old who are wise not only the aged who understand what is right.
Therefore I say Listen to me I too will tell you what I know.
I waited while you spoke I listened to your reasoning while you were searching for words
I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong none of you has answered his arguments.
Do not say We have found wisdom let God refute him not man.
But Job has not marshaled his words against me and I will not answer him with your arguments.
They are dismayed and have no more to say words have failed them.
Must I wait now that they are silent now that they stand there with no reply?
I too will have my say I too will tell what I know.
For I am full of words and the spirit within me compels me
inside I am like bottledup wine like new wineskins ready to burst.
I must speak and find relief I must open my lips and reply.
I will show partiality to no one nor will I flatter any man
for if I were skilled in flattery my Maker would soon take me away.
But now Job listen to my words pay attention to everything I say.
I am about to open my mouth my words are on the tip of my tongue.
My words come from an upright heart my lips sincerely speak what I know.
The Spirit of God has made me the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
Answer me then if you can prepare yourself and confront me.
I am just like you before God I too have been taken from clay.
No fear of me should alarm you nor should my hand be heavy upon you.
But you have said in my hearing I heard the very words
I am pure and without sin I am clean and free from guilt.
Yet God has found fault with me he considers me his enemy.
He fastens my feet in shackles he keeps close watch on all my paths.
But I tell you in this you are not right for God is greater than man.
Why do you complain to him that he answers none of mans words?
For God does speaknow one way now another though man may not perceive it.
In a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds
he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings
to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride
to preserve his soul from the pit his life from perishing by the sword.
Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones
so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.
His flesh wastes away to nothing and his bones once hidden now stick out.
His soul draws near to the pit and his life to the messengers of death.
Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator one out of a thousand to tell a man what is right for him
to be gracious to him and say Spare him from going down to the pit I have found a ransom for him
then his flesh is renewed like a childs it is restored as in the days of his youth.
He prays to God and finds favor with him he sees Gods face and shouts for joy he is restored by God to his righteous state.
Then he comes to men and says I sinned and perverted what was right but I did not get what I deserved.
He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit and I will live to enjoy the light.
God does all these things to a man twice even three times
to turn back his soul from the pit that the light of life may shine on him.
Pay attention Job and listen to me be silent and I will speak.
If you have anything to say answer me speak up for I want you to be cleared.
But if not then listen to me be silent and I will teach you wisdom.
Then Elihu said
Hear my words you wise men listen to me you men of learning.
For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.
Let us discern for ourselves what is right let us learn together what is good.
Job says I am innocent but God denies me justice.
Although I am right I am considered a liar although I am guiltless his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.
What man is like Job who drinks scorn like water?
He keeps company with evildoers he associates with wicked men.
For he says It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.
So listen to me you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil from the Almighty to do wrong.
He repays a man for what he has done he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.
It is unthinkable that God would do wrong that the Almighty would pervert justice.
Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?
If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath
all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.
Then Elihu said
Do you think this is just? You say I will be cleared by God.
Yet you ask him What profit is it to me and what do I gain by not sinning?
I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.
Look up at the heavens and see gaze at the clouds so high above you.
If you sin how does that affect him? If your sins are many what does that do to him?
If you are righteous what do you give to him or what does he receive from your hand?
Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself and your righteousness only the sons of men.
Men cry out under a load of oppression they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
But no one says Where is God my Maker who gives songs in the night
who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?
He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
Indeed God does not listen to their empty plea the Almighty pays no attention to it.
How much less then will he listen when you say that you do not see him that your case is before him and you must wait for him
and further that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.
So Job opens his mouth with empty talk without knowledge he multiplies words.
Elihu continued
Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in Gods behalf.
I get my knowledge from afar I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
Be assured that my words are not false one perfect in knowledge is with you.
God is mighty but does not despise men he is mighty and firm in his purpose.
He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.
He does not take his eyes off the righteous he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
But if men are bound in chains held fast by cords of affliction
he tells them what they have done that they have sinned arrogantly.
He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.
If they obey and serve him they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.
But if they do not listen they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
The godless in heart harbor resentment even when he fetters them they do not cry for help.
They die in their youth among male prostitutes of the shrines.
But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering he speaks to them in their affliction.
He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
Be careful that no one entices you by riches do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?
Do not long for the night to drag people away from their homes.
Beware of turning to evil which you seem to prefer to affliction.
God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?
Who has prescribed his ways for him or said to him You have done wrong?
At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.
Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.
After that comes the sound of his roar he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds he holds nothing back.
Gods voice thunders in marvelous ways he does great things beyond our understanding.
He says to the snow Fall on the earth and to the rain shower Be a mighty downpour.
So that all men he has made may know his work he stops every man from his labor.
The animals take cover they remain in their dens.
The tempest comes out from its chamber the cold from the driving winds.
The breath of God produces ice and the broad waters become frozen.
He loads the clouds with moisture he scatters his lightning through them.
At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.
He brings the clouds to punish men or to water his earth and show his love.
Listen to this Job stop and consider Gods wonders.
Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?
Do you know how the clouds hang poised those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?
You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind
can you join him in spreading out the skies hard as a mirror of cast bronze?
Tell us what we should say to him we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?
Now no one can look at the sun bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.
Out of the north he comes in golden splendor God comes in awesome majesty.
The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power in his justice and great righteousness he does not oppress.
Therefore men revere him for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?
Then the Lord answered Job out of the storm. He said
Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?
Brace yourself like a man I will question you and you shall answer me.
Where were you when I laid the earths foundation? Tell me if you understand.
Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?
On what were its footings set or who laid its cornerstone
while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?
Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb
when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness
when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place
when I said This far you may come and no farther here is where your proud waves halt?
Have you ever given orders to the morning or shown the dawn its place
that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?
The earth takes shape like clay under a seal its features stand out like those of a garment.
The wicked are denied their light and their upraised arm is broken.
Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?
Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me if you know all this.
What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?
Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
Surely you know for you were already born! You have lived so many years!
Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail
which I reserve for times of trouble for days of war and battle?
What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain and a path for the thunderstorm
to water a land where no man lives a desert with no one in it
to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?
Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?
Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?
They crouch down and bring forth their young their labor pains are ended.
Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds they leave and do not return.
Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes?
I gave him the wasteland as his home the salt flats as his habitat.
He laughs at the commotion in the town he does not hear a drivers shout.
He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.
Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?
Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you?
Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him?
Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?
The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork.
She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand
unmindful that a foot may crush them that some wild animal may trample them.
She treats her young harshly as if they were not hers she cares not that her labor was in vain
for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.
Yet when she spreads her feathers to run she laughs at horse and rider.
Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?
Do you make him leap like a locust striking terror with his proud snorting?
He paws fiercely rejoicing in his strength and charges into the fray.
He laughs at fear afraid of nothing he does not shy away from the sword.
The quiver rattles against his side along with the flashing spear and lance.
The Lord said to Job
Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!
Then Job answered the Lord
I am unworthyhow can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.
I spoke once but I have no answer twice but I will say no more.
Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm
Brace yourself like a man I will question you and you shall answer me.
Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
Do you have an arm like Gods and can your voice thunder like his?
Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.
Unleash the fury of your wrath look at every proud man and bring him low
look at every proud man and humble him crush the wicked where they stand.
Bury them all in the dust together shroud their faces in the grave.
Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.
Look at the behemoth which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.
What strength he has in his loins what power in the muscles of his belly!
His tail sways like a cedar the sinews of his thighs are closeknit.
His bones are tubes of bronze his limbs like rods of iron.
He ranks first among the works of God yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.
The hills bring him their produce and all the wild animals play nearby.
Under the lotus plants he lies hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
The lotuses conceal him in their shadow the poplars by the stream surround him.
When the river rages he is not alarmed he is secure though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.
Can anyone capture him by the eyes or trap him and pierce his nose?
Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?
Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?
Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?
Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
If you lay a hand on him you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
Any hope of subduing him is false the mere sight of him is overpowering.
No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?
Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
I will not fail to speak of his limbs his strength and his graceful form.
Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?
Who dares open the doors of his mouth ringed about with his fearsome teeth?
His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together
each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
Then Job replied to the Lord
I know that you can do all things no plan of yours can be thwarted.
You asked Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge? Surely I spoke of things I did not understand things too wonderful for me to know.
You said Listen now and I will speak I will question you and you shall answer me.
My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord and on his law he meditates day and night.
He is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.
Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked will perish.
Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?
The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One.
Let us break their chains they say and throw off their fetters.
The One enthroned in heaven laughs the Lord scoffs at them.
Then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath saying
I have installed my King on Zion my holy hill.
I will proclaim the decree of the Lord He said to me You are my Son today I have become your Father.
O Lord how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!
Many are saying of me God will not deliver him. Selah
But you are a shield around me O Lord you bestow glory on me and lift up my head.
To the Lord I cry aloud and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah
I lie down and sleep I wake again because the Lord sustains me.
I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side.
Arise O Lord! Deliver me O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw break the teeth of the wicked.
From the Lord comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people. Selah
Answer me when I call to you O my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress be merciful to me and hear my prayer.
How long O men will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods? Selah
Know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself the Lord will hear when I call to him.
In your anger do not sin when you are on your beds search your hearts and be silent. Selah
Offer right sacrifices and trust in the Lord.
Many are asking Who can show us any good? Let the light of your face shine upon us O Lord.
You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.
I will lie down and sleep in peace for you alone O Lord make me dwell in safety.
Give ear to my words O Lord consider my sighing.
Listen to my cry for help my King and my God for to you I pray.
In the morning O Lord you hear my voice in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.
You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil with you the wicked cannot dwell.
The arrogant cannot stand in your presence you hate all who do wrong.
You destroy those who tell lies bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors.
But I by your great mercy will come into your house in reverence will I bow down toward your holy temple.
Lead me O Lord in your righteousness because of my enemies make straight your way before me.
Not a word from their mouth can be trusted their heart is filled with destruction. Their throat is an open grave with their tongue they speak deceit.
O Lord do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
Be merciful to me Lord for I am faint O Lord heal me for my bones are in agony.
My soul is in anguish. How long O Lord how long?
Turn O Lord and deliver me save me because of your unfailing love.
No one remembers you when he is dead. Who praises you from the grave?
I am worn out from groaning all night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
My eyes grow weak with sorrow they fail because of all my foes.
Away from me all you who do evil for the Lord has heard my weeping.
The Lord has heard my cry for mercy the Lord accepts my prayer.
All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed they will turn back in sudden disgrace.
O Lord my God I take refuge in you save and deliver me from all who pursue me
or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
O Lord my God if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands
if I have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe
then let my enemy pursue and overtake me let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust. Selah
Arise O Lord in your anger rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake my God decree justice.
Let the assembled peoples gather around you. Rule over them from on high
let the Lord judge the peoples. Judge me O Lord according to my righteousness according to my integrity O Most High.
O Lord our Lord how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.
From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because of your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger.
When I consider your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have set in place
what is man that you are mindful of him the son of man that you care for him?
You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.
You made him ruler over the works of your hands you put everything under his feet
all flocks and herds and the beasts of the field
the birds of the air and the fish of the sea all that swim the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Lord how majestic is your name in all the earth!
I will praise you O Lord with all my heart I will tell of all your wonders.
I will be glad and rejoice in you I will sing praise to your name O Most High.
My enemies turn back they stumble and perish before you.
For you have upheld my right and my cause you have sat on your throne judging righteously.
You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy you have uprooted their cities even the memory of them has perished.
The Lord reigns forever he has established his throne for judgment.
He will judge the world in righteousness he will govern the peoples with justice.
The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed a stronghold in times of trouble.
Those who know your name will trust in you for you Lord have never forsaken those who seek you.
Sing praises to the Lord enthroned in Zion proclaim among the nations what he has done.
For he who avenges blood remembers he does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.
O Lord see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death
that I may declare your praises in the gates of the Daughter of Zion and there rejoice in your salvation.
The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
The Lord is known by his justice the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah
The wicked return to the grave all the nations that forget God.
Why O Lord do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak who are caught in the schemes he devises.
He boasts of the cravings of his heart he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord.
In his pride the wicked does not seek him in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
His ways are always prosperous he is haughty and your laws are far from him he sneers at all his enemies.
He says to himself Nothing will shake me Ill always be happy and never have trouble.
In the Lord I take refuge. How then can you say to me Flee like a bird to your mountain.
For look the wicked bend their bows they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
When the foundations are being destroyed what can the righteous do?
The Lord is in his holy temple the Lord is on his heavenly throne. He observes the sons of men his eyes examine them.
The Lord examines the righteous but the wicked and those who love violence his soul hates.
On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur a scorching wind will be their lot.
For the Lord is righteous he loves justice upright men will see his face.
Help Lord for the godly are no more the faithful have vanished from among men.
Everyone lies to his neighbor their flattering lips speak with deception.
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue
that says We will triumph with our tongues we own our lips who is our master?
Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy I will now arise says the Lord. I will protect them from those who malign them.
How long O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart? How long will my enemy triumph over me?
Look on me and answer O Lord my God. Give light to my eyes or I will sleep in death
my enemy will say I have overcome him and my foes will rejoice when I fall.
But I trust in your unfailing love my heart rejoices in your salvation.
I will sing to the Lord for he has been good to me.
The fool says in his heart There is no God. They are corrupt their deeds are vile there is no one who does good.
The Lord looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand any who seek God.
All have turned aside they have together become corrupt there is no one who does good not even one.
Will evildoers never learn those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on the Lord?
Lord who may dwell in your sanctuary? Who may live on your holy hill?
He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous who speaks the truth from his heart
and has no slander on his tongue who does his neighbor no wrong and casts no slur on his fellowman
who despises a vile man but honors those who fear the Lord who keeps his oath even when it hurts
who lends his money without usury and does not accept a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
Keep me safe O God for in you I take refuge.
I said to the Lord You are my Lord apart from you I have no good thing.
As for the saints who are in the land they are the glorious ones in whom is all my delight.
The sorrows of those will increase who run after other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood or take up their names on my lips.
Lord you have assigned me my portion and my cup you have made my lot secure.
The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places surely I have a delightful inheritance.
I will praise the Lord who counsels me even at night my heart instructs me.
I have set the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand I will not be shaken.
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices my body also will rest secure
because you will not abandon me to the grave nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
You have made known to me the path of life you will fill me with joy in your presence with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
Hear O Lord my righteous plea listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer it does not rise from deceitful lips.
May my vindication come from you may your eyes see what is right.
Though you probe my heart and examine me at night though you test me you will find nothing I have resolved that my mouth will not sin.
As for the deeds of men by the word of your lips I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.
My steps have held to your paths my feet have not slipped.
I call on you O God for you will answer me give ear to me and hear my prayer.
Show the wonder of your great love you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes.
Keep me as the apple of your eye hide me in the shadow of your wings
from the wicked who assail me from my mortal enemies who surround me.
They close up their callous hearts and their mouths speak with arrogance.
They have tracked me down they now surround me with eyes alert to throw me to the ground.
They are like a lion hungry for prey like a great lion crouching in cover.
Rise up O Lord confront them bring them down rescue me from the wicked by your sword.
O Lord by your hand save me from such men from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish their sons have plenty and they store up wealth for their children.
And Iin righteousness I will see your face when I awake I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.
I love you O Lord my strength.
The Lord is my rock my fortress and my deliverer my God is my rock in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn of my salvation my stronghold.
I call to the Lord who is worthy of praise and I am saved from my enemies.
The cords of death entangled me the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
The cords of the grave coiled around me the snares of death confronted me.
In my distress I called to the Lord I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice my cry came before him into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked and the foundations of the mountains shook they trembled because he was angry.
Smoke rose from his nostrils consuming fire came from his mouth burning coals blazed out of it.
He parted the heavens and came down dark clouds were under his feet.
He mounted the cherubim and flew he soared on the wings of the wind.
He made darkness his covering his canopy around him the dark rain clouds of the sky.
Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced with hailstones and bolts of lightning.
The Lord thundered from heaven the voice of the Most High resounded.
The heavens declare the glory of God the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
Day after day they pour forth speech night after night they display knowledge.
There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
Their voice goes out into all the earth their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun
which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other nothing is hidden from its heat.
The law of the Lord is perfect reviving the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy making wise the simple.
The precepts of the Lord are right giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant giving light to the eyes.
May the Lord answer you when you are in distress may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.
May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings. Selah
May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.
We will shout for joy when you are victorious and will lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the Lord grant all your requests.
Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed he answers him from his holy heaven with the saving power of his right hand.
Some trust in chariots and some in horses but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
They are brought to their knees and fall but we rise up and stand firm.
O Lord save the king! Answer us when we call!
O Lord the king rejoices in your strength. How great is his joy in the victories you give!
You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah
You welcomed him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
He asked you for life and you gave it to him length of days for ever and ever.
Through the victories you gave his glory is great you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.
Surely you have granted him eternal blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.
For the king trusts in the Lord through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken.
Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies your right hand will seize your foes.
At the time of your appearing you will make them like a fiery furnace. In his wrath the Lord will swallow them up and his fire will consume them.
You will destroy their descendants from the earth their posterity from mankind.
Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes they cannot succeed
for you will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow.
Be exalted O Lord in your strength we will sing and praise your might.
My God my God why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me so far from the words of my groaning?
O my God I cry out by day but you do not answer by night and am not silent.
Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One you are the praise of Israel.
In you our fathers put their trust they trusted and you delivered them.
They cried to you and were saved in you they trusted and were not disappointed.
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not be in want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures he leads me beside quiet waters
he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his names sake.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil my cup overflows.
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
The earth is the Lords and everything in it the world and all who live in it
for he founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.
Who may ascend the hill of the Lord? Who may stand in his holy place?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false.
He will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God his Savior.
Such is the generation of those who seek him who seek your face O God of Jacob. Selah
Lift up your heads O you gates be lifted up you ancient doors that the King of glory may come in.
Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty the Lord mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads O you gates lift them up you ancient doors that the King of glory may come in.
Who is he this King of glory? The Lord Almighty he is the King of glory. Selah
To you O Lord I lift up my soul
in you I trust O my God. Do not let me be put to shame nor let my enemies triumph over me.
No one whose hope is in you will ever be put to shame but they will be put to shame who are treacherous without excuse.
Show me your ways O Lord teach me your paths
guide me in your truth and teach me for you are God my Savior and my hope is in you all day long.
Remember O Lord your great mercy and love for they are from of old.
Remember not the sins of my youth and my rebellious ways according to your love remember me for you are good O Lord.
Good and upright is the Lord therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.
All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful for those who keep the demands of his covenant.
For the sake of your name O Lord forgive my iniquity though it is great.
Vindicate me O Lord for I have led a blameless life I have trusted in the Lord without wavering.
Test me O Lord and try me examine my heart and my mind
for your love is ever before me and I walk continually in your truth.
I do not sit with deceitful men nor do I consort with hypocrites
I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked.
I wash my hands in innocence and go about your altar O Lord
proclaiming aloud your praise and telling of all your wonderful deeds.
I love the house where you live O Lord the place where your glory dwells.
Do not take away my soul along with sinners my life with bloodthirsty men
in whose hands are wicked schemes whose right hands are full of bribes.
But I lead a blameless life redeem me and be merciful to me.
My feet stand on level ground in the great assembly I will praise the Lord.
The Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life of whom shall I be afraid?
When evil men advance against me to devour my flesh when my enemies and my foes attack me they will stumble and fall.
Though an army besiege me my heart will not fear though war break out against me even then will I be confident.
One thing I ask of the Lord this is what I seek that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.
For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle and set me high upon a rock.
Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy I will sing and make music to the Lord.
Hear my voice when I call O Lord be merciful to me and answer me.
My heart says of you Seek his face! Your face Lord I will seek.
To you I call O Lord my Rock do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent I will be like those who have gone down to the pit.
Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
Do not drag me away with the wicked with those who do evil who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.
Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work repay them for what their hands have done and bring back upon them what they deserve.
Since they show no regard for the works of the Lord and what his hands have done he will tear them down and never build them up again.
Praise be to the Lord for he has heard my cry for mercy.
The Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusts in him and I am helped. My heart leaps for joy and I will give thanks to him in song.
The Lord is the strength of his people a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
Save your people and bless your inheritance be their shepherd and carry them forever.
Ascribe to the Lord O mighty ones ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
The voice of the Lord is over the waters the God of glory thunders the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
The voice of the Lord is powerful the voice of the Lord is majestic.
The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes Lebanon skip like a calf Sirion like a young wild ox.
The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning.
The voice of the Lord shakes the desert the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry Glory!
The Lord sits enthroned over the flood the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
The Lord gives strength to his people the Lord blesses his people with peace.
I will exalt you O Lord for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.
O Lord my God I called to you for help and you healed me.
O Lord you brought me up from the grave you spared me from going down into the pit.
Sing to the Lord you saints of his praise his holy name.
For his anger lasts only a moment but his favor lasts a lifetime weeping may remain for a night but rejoicing comes in the morning.
When I felt secure I said I will never be shaken.
O Lord when you favored me you made my mountain stand firm but when you hid your face I was dismayed.
To you O Lord I called to the Lord I cried for mercy
What gain is there in my destruction in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?
Hear O Lord and be merciful to me O Lord be my help.
You turned my wailing into dancing you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy
that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O Lord my God I will give you thanks forever.
In you O Lord I have taken refuge let me never be put to shame deliver me in your righteousness.
Turn your ear to me come quickly to my rescue be my rock of refuge a strong fortress to save me.
Since you are my rock and my fortress for the sake of your name lead and guide me.
Free me from the trap that is set for me for you are my refuge.
Into your hands I commit my spirit redeem me O Lord the God of truth.
I hate those who cling to worthless idols I trust in the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in your love for you saw my affliction and knew the anguish of my soul.
You have not handed me over to the enemy but have set my feet in a spacious place.
Be merciful to me O Lord for I am in distress my eyes grow weak with sorrow my soul and my body with grief.
My life is consumed by anguish and my years by groaning my strength fails because of my affliction and my bones grow weak.
Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.
When I kept silent my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah
Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah
Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found surely when the mighty waters rise they will not reach him.
You are my hiding place you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go I will counsel you and watch over you.
Do not be like the horse or the mule which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.
Many are the woes of the wicked but the Lords unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him.
Rejoice in the Lord and be glad you righteous sing all you who are upright in heart!
Sing joyfully to the Lord you righteous it is fitting for the upright to praise him.
Praise the Lord with the harp make music to him on the tenstringed lyre.
Sing to him a new song play skillfully and shout for joy.
For the word of the Lord is right and true he is faithful in all he does.
The Lord loves righteousness and justice the earth is full of his unfailing love.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made their starry host by the breath of his mouth.
He gathers the waters of the sea into jars he puts the deep into storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the Lord let all the people of the world revere him.
For he spoke and it came to be he commanded and it stood firm.
The Lord foils the plans of the nations he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.
But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever the purposes of his heart through all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord the people he chose for his inheritance.
From heaven the Lord looks down and sees all mankind
from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earth
he who forms the hearts of all who considers everything they do.
No king is saved by the size of his army no warrior escapes by his great strength.
A horse is a vain hope for deliverance despite all its great strength it cannot save.
But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him on those whose hope is in his unfailing love
to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.
We wait in hope for the Lord he is our help and our shield.
In him our hearts rejoice for we trust in his holy name.
May your unfailing love rest upon us O Lord even as we put our hope in you.
I will extol the Lord at all times his praise will always be on my lips.
My soul will boast in the Lord let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
Glorify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together.
I sought the Lord and he answered me he delivered me from all my fears.
Those who look to him are radiant their faces are never covered with shame.
This poor man called and the Lord heard him he saved him out of all his troubles.
The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him and he delivers them.
Taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
Fear the Lord you his saints for those who fear him lack nothing.
The lions may grow weak and hungry but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
Come my children listen to me I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days
keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking lies.
Turn from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry
the face of the Lord is against those who do evil to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
The righteous cry out and the Lord hears them he delivers them from all their troubles.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
A righteous man may have many troubles but the Lord delivers him from them all
he protects all his bones not one of them will be broken.
Evil will slay the wicked the foes of the righteous will be condemned.
The Lord redeems his servants no one will be condemned who takes refuge in him.
Contend O Lord with those who contend with me fight against those who fight against me.
Take up shield and buckler arise and come to my aid.
Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to my soul I am your salvation.
May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.
May they be like chaff before the wind with the angel of the Lord driving them away
may their path be dark and slippery with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me
may ruin overtake them by surprise may the net they hid entangle them may they fall into the pit to their ruin.
Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord and delight in his salvation.
My whole being will exclaim Who is like you O Lord? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them the poor and needy from those who rob them.
Ruthless witnesses come forward they question me on things I know nothing about.
An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.
The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful he has ceased to be wise and to do good.
Even on his bed he plots evil he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong.
Your love O Lord reaches to the heavens your faithfulness to the skies.
Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains your justice like the great deep. O Lord you preserve both man and beast.
How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find refuge in the shadow of your wings.
They feast on the abundance of your house you give them drink from your river of delights.
For with you is the fountain of life in your light we see light.
Continue your love to those who know you your righteousness to the upright in heart.
May the foot of the proud not come against me nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
See how the evildoers lie fallen thrown down not able to rise!
Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong
for like the grass they will soon wither like green plants they will soon die away.
Trust in the Lord and do good dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.
Commit your way to the Lord trust in him and he will do this
He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.
Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him do not fret when men succeed in their ways when they carry out their wicked schemes.
Refrain from anger and turn from wrath do not fretit leads only to evil.
For evil men will be cut off but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.
A little while and the wicked will be no more though you look for them they will not be found.
But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace.
The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them
but the Lord laughs at the wicked for he knows their day is coming.
The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy to slay those whose ways are upright.
But their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken.
Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked
for the power of the wicked will be broken but the Lord upholds the righteous.
The days of the blameless are known to the Lord and their inheritance will endure forever.
In times of disaster they will not wither in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.
But the wicked will perish The Lords enemies will be like the beauty of the fields they will vanishvanish like smoke.
The wicked borrow and do not repay but the righteous give generously
O Lord do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
For your arrows have pierced me and your hand has come down upon me.
Because of your wrath there is no health in my body my bones have no soundness because of my sin.
My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.
My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.
I am bowed down and brought very low all day long I go about mourning.
My back is filled with searing pain there is no health in my body.
I am feeble and utterly crushed I groan in anguish of heart.
All my longings lie open before you O Lord my sighing is not hidden from you.
My heart pounds my strength fails me even the light has gone from my eyes.
My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds my neighbors stay far away.
Those who seek my life set their traps those who would harm me talk of my ruin all day long they plot deception.
I said I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence.
But when I was silent and still not even saying anything good my anguish increased.
My heart grew hot within me and as I meditated the fire burned then I spoke with my tongue
Show me O Lord my lifes end and the number of my days let me know how fleeting is my life.
You have made my days a mere handbreadth the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each mans life is but a breath. Selah
Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro He bustles about but only in vain he heaps up wealth not knowing who will get it.
But now Lord what do I look for? My hope is in you.
Save me from all my transgressions do not make me the scorn of fools.
I was silent I would not open my mouth for you are the one who has done this.
Remove your scourge from me I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
You rebuke and discipline men for their sin you consume their wealth like a moth each man is but a breath. Selah
Hear my prayer O Lord listen to my cry for help be not deaf to my weeping. For I dwell with you as an alien a stranger as all my fathers were.
Look away from me that I may rejoice again before I depart and am no more.
I waited patiently for the Lord he turned to me and heard my cry.
He lifted me out of the slimy pit out of the mud and mire he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
He put a new song in my mouth a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust who does not look to the proud to those who turn aside to false gods.
Many O Lord my God are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you were I to speak and tell of them they would be too many to declare.
Sacrifice and offering you did not desire but my ears you have pierced burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.
Then I said Here I am I have come it is written about me in the scroll.
I desire to do your will O my God your law is within my heart.
I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly I do not seal my lips as you know O Lord.
I do not hide your righteousness in my heart I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly.
Do not withhold your mercy from me O Lord may your love and your truth always protect me.
For troubles without number surround me my sins have overtaken me and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head and my heart fails within me.
Blessed is he who has regard for the weak the Lord delivers him in times of trouble.
The Lord will protect him and preserve his life he will bless him in the land and not surrender him to the desire of his foes.
The Lord will sustain him on his sickbed and restore him from his bed of illness.
I said O Lord have mercy on me heal me for I have sinned against you.
My enemies say of me in malice When will he die and his name perish?
Whenever one comes to see me he speaks falsely while his heart gathers slander then he goes out and spreads it abroad.
All my enemies whisper together against me they imagine the worst for me saying
A vile disease has beset him he will never get up from the place where he lies.
Even my close friend whom I trusted he who shared my bread has lifted up his heel against me.
But you O Lord have mercy on me raise me up that I may repay them.
As the deer pants for streams of water so my soul pants for you O God.
My soul thirsts for God for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?
My tears have been my food day and night while men say to me all day long Where is your God?
These things I remember as I pour out my soul how I used to go with the multitude leading the procession to the house of God with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng.
Vindicate me O God and plead my cause against an ungodly nation rescue me from deceitful and wicked men.
You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning oppressed by the enemy?
Send forth your light and your truth let them guide me let them bring me to your holy mountain to the place where you dwell.
Then will I go to the altar of God to God my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the harp O God my God.
Why are you downcast O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God for I will yet praise him my Savior and my God.
We have heard with our ears O God our fathers have told us what you did in their days in days long ago.
With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.
It was not by their sword that they won the land nor did their arm bring them victory it was your right hand your arm and the light of your face for you loved them.
You are my King and my God who decrees victories for Jacob.
Through you we push back our enemies through your name we trample our foes.
I do not trust in my bow my sword does not bring me victory
but you give us victory over our enemies you put our adversaries to shame.
In God we make our boast all day long and we will praise your name forever. Selah
But now you have rejected and humbled us you no longer go out with our armies.
You made us retreat before the enemy and our adversaries have plundered us.
You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.
You sold your people for a pittance gaining nothing from their sale.
You have made us a reproach to our neighbors the scorn and derision of those around us.
You have made us a byword among the nations the peoples shake their heads at us.
My disgrace is before me all day long and my face is covered with shame
at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me because of the enemy who is bent on revenge.
My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses for the king my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with grace since God has blessed you forever.
Gird your sword upon your side O mighty one clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth humility and righteousness let your right hand display awesome deeds.
Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the kings enemies let the nations fall beneath your feet.
Your throne O God will last for ever and ever a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
You love righteousness and hate wickedness therefore God your God has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.
All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia from palaces adorned with ivory the music of the strings makes you glad.
Daughters of kings are among your honored women at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.
Listen O daughter consider and give ear Forget your people and your fathers house.
God is our refuge and strength an everpresent help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea
though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. Selah
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God the holy place where the Most High dwells.
God is within her she will not fall God will help her at break of day.
Nations are in uproar kingdoms fall he lifts his voice the earth melts.
The Lord Almighty is with us the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
Come and see the works of the Lord the desolations he has brought on the earth.
Clap your hands all you nations shout to God with cries of joy.
How awesome is the Lord Most High the great King over all the earth!
He subdued nations under us peoples under our feet.
He chose our inheritance for us the pride of Jacob whom he loved. Selah
God has ascended amid shouts of joy the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.
Sing praises to God sing praises sing praises to our King sing praises.
For God is the King of all the earth sing to him a psalm of praise.
God reigns over the nations God is seated on his holy throne.
The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham for the kings of the earth belong to God he is greatly exalted.
Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise in the city of our God his holy mountain.
It is beautiful in its loftiness the joy of the whole earth. Like the utmost heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion the city of the Great King.
God is in her citadels he has shown himself to be her fortress.
When the kings joined forces when they advanced together
they saw her and were astounded they fled in terror.
Trembling seized them there pain like that of a woman in labor.
You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.
As we have heard so have we seen in the city of the Lord Almighty in the city of our God God makes her secure forever. Selah
Within your temple O God we meditate on your unfailing love.
Like your name O God your praise reaches to the ends of the earth your right hand is filled with righteousness.
Mount Zion rejoices the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments.
Walk about Zion go around her count her towers
consider well her ramparts view her citadels that you may tell of them to the next generation.
For this God is our God for ever and ever he will be our guide even to the end.
Hear this all you peoples listen all who live in this world
both low and high rich and poor alike
My mouth will speak words of wisdom the utterance from my heart will give understanding.
I will turn my ear to a proverb with the harp I will expound my riddle
Why should I fear when evil days come when wicked deceivers surround me
those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?
No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him
the ransom for a life is costly no payment is ever enough
that he should live on forever and not see decay.
For all can see that wise men die the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others.
Their tombs will remain their houses forever their dwellings for endless generations though they had named lands after themselves.
But man despite his riches does not endure he is like the beasts that perish.
This is the fate of those who trust in themselves and of their followers who approve their sayings. Selah
Like sheep they are destined for the grave and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning their forms will decay in the grave far from their princely mansions.
But God will redeem my life from the grave he will surely take me to himself. Selah
Do not be overawed when a man grows rich when the splendor of his house increases
for he will take nothing with him when he dies his splendor will not descend with him.
Though while he lived he counted himself blessed and men praise you when you prosper
he will join the generation of his fathers who will never see the light of life.
A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
The Mighty One God the Lord speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets.
From Zion perfect in beauty God shines forth.
Our God comes and will not be silent a fire devours before him and around him a tempest rages.
He summons the heavens above and the earth that he may judge his people
Gather to me my consecrated ones who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
And the heavens proclaim his righteousness for God himself is judge. Selah
Hear O my people and I will speak O Israel and I will testify against you I am God your God.
I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings which are ever before me.
I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens
for every animal of the forest is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills.
I know every bird in the mountains and the creatures of the field are mine.
If I were hungry I would not tell you for the world is mine and all that is in it.
Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
Sacrifice thank offerings to God fulfill your vows to the Most High
and call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver you and you will honor me.
But to the wicked God says What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?
You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.
When you see a thief you join with him you throw in your lot with adulterers.
Have mercy on me O God according to your unfailing love according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.
Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me.
Against you you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.
Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
Surely you desire truth in the inner parts you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be clean wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
Let me hear joy and gladness let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
Why do you boast of evil you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?
Your tongue plots destruction it is like a sharpened razor you who practice deceit.
You love evil rather than good falsehood rather than speaking the truth. Selah
You love every harmful word O you deceitful tongue!
Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin He will snatch you up and tear you from your tent he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
The fool says in his heart There is no God. They are corrupt and their ways are vile there is no one who does good.
God looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand any who seek God.
Everyone has turned away they have together become corrupt there is no one who does good not even one.
Will the evildoers never learn those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on God?
There they were overwhelmed with dread where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you you put them to shame for God despised them.
Oh that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
Save me O God by your name vindicate me by your might.
Hear my prayer O God listen to the words of my mouth.
Strangers are attacking me ruthless men seek my life men without regard for God. Selah
Surely God is my help the Lord is the one who sustains me.
Let evil recoil on those who slander me in your faithfulness destroy them.
I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you I will praise your name O Lord for it is good.
For he has delivered me from all my troubles and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
Listen to my prayer O God do not ignore my plea
hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught
at the voice of the enemy at the stares of the wicked for they bring down suffering upon me and revile me in their anger.
My heart is in anguish within me the terrors of death assail me.
Fear and trembling have beset me horror has overwhelmed me.
I said Oh that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest
I would flee far away and stay in the desert Selah
I would hurry to my place of shelter far from the tempest and storm.
Confuse the wicked O Lord confound their speech for I see violence and strife in the city.
Day and night they prowl about on its walls malice and abuse are within it.
Destructive forces are at work in the city threats and lies never leave its streets.
If an enemy were insulting me I could endure it if a foe were raising himself against me I could hide from him.
Be merciful to me O God for men hotly pursue me all day long they press their attack.
My slanderers pursue me all day long many are attacking me in their pride.
When I am afraid I will trust in you.
In God whose word I praise in God I trust I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?
All day long they twist my words they are always plotting to harm me.
They conspire they lurk they watch my steps eager to take my life.
On no account let them escape in your anger O God bring down the nations.
Record my lament list my tears on your scroll are they not in your record?
Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.
In God whose word I praise in the Lord whose word I praise
Have mercy on me O God have mercy on me for in you my soul takes refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.
I cry out to God Most High to God who fulfills his purpose for me.
He sends from heaven and saves me rebuking those who hotly pursue me Selah God sends his love and his faithfulness.
I am in the midst of lions I lie among ravenous beasts men whose teeth are spears and arrows whose tongues are sharp swords.
Be exalted O God above the heavens let your glory be over all the earth.
They spread a net for my feet I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah
My heart is steadfast O God my heart is steadfast I will sing and make music.
Awake my soul! Awake harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
I will praise you O Lord among the nations I will sing of you among the peoples.
For great is your love reaching to the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
Be exalted O God above the heavens let your glory be over all the earth.
Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge uprightly among men?
No in your heart you devise injustice and your hands mete out violence on the earth.
Even from birth the wicked go astray from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.
Their venom is like the venom of a snake like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears
that will not heed the tune of the charmer however skillful the enchanter may be.
Break the teeth in their mouths O God tear out O Lord the fangs of the lions!
Let them vanish like water that flows away when they draw the bow let their arrows be blunted.
Like a slug melting away as it moves along like a stillborn child may they not see the sun.
Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns whether they be green or drythe wicked will be swept away.
The righteous will be glad when they are avenged when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
Then men will say Surely the righteous still are rewarded surely there is a God who judges the earth.
Deliver me from my enemies O God protect me from those who rise up against me.
Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men.
See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine O Lord.
I have done no wrong yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me look on my plight!
O Lord God Almighty the God of Israel rouse yourself to punish all the nations show no mercy to wicked traitors. Selah
They return at evening snarling like dogs and prowl about the city.
See what they spew from their mouths they spew out swords from their lips and they say Who can hear us?
But you O Lord laugh at them you scoff at all those nations.
O my Strength I watch for you you O God are my fortress
my loving God. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
But do not kill them O Lord our shield or my people will forget. In your might make them wander about and bring them down.
You have rejected us O God and burst forth upon us you have been angrynow restore us!
You have shaken the land and torn it open mend its fractures for it is quaking.
You have shown your people desperate times you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
But for those who fear you you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow. Selah
Save us and help us with your right hand that those you love may be delivered.
God has spoken from his sanctuary In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine Ephraim is my helmet Judah my scepter.
Hear my cry O God listen to my prayer.
From the ends of the earth I call to you I call as my heart grows faint lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For you have been my refuge a strong tower against the foe.
I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah
For you have heard my vows O God you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
Increase the days of the kings life his years for many generations.
May he be enthroned in Gods presence forever appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.
Then will I ever sing praise to your name and fulfill my vows day after day.
My soul finds rest in God alone my salvation comes from him.
He alone is my rock and my salvation he is my fortress I will never be shaken.
How long will you assault a man? Would all of you throw him down this leaning wall this tottering fence?
They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless but in their hearts they curse. Selah
Find rest O my soul in God alone my hope comes from him.
He alone is my rock and my salvation he is my fortress I will not be shaken.
My salvation and my honor depend on God he is my mighty rock my refuge.
Trust in him at all times O people pour out your hearts to him for God is our refuge. Selah
Lowborn men are but a breath the highborn are but a lie if weighed on a balance they are nothing together they are only a breath.
Do not trust in extortion or take pride in stolen goods though your riches increase do not set your heart on them.
O God you are my God earnestly I seek you my soul thirsts for you my body longs for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.
Because your love is better than life my lips will glorify you.
I will praise you as long as I live and in your name I will lift up my hands.
My soul will be satisfied as with the richest of foods with singing lips my mouth will praise you.
On my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night.
Because you are my help I sing in the shadow of your wings.
My soul clings to you your right hand upholds me.
They who seek my life will be destroyed they will go down to the depths of the earth.
Hear me O God as I voice my complaint protect my life from the threat of the enemy.
Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked from that noisy crowd of evildoers.
They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.
They shoot from ambush at the innocent man they shoot at him suddenly without fear.
They encourage each other in evil plans they talk about hiding their snares they say Who will see them?
They plot injustice and say We have devised a perfect plan! Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning.
But God will shoot them with arrows suddenly they will be struck down.
He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
All mankind will fear they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.
Let the righteous rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him let all the upright in heart praise him!
Praise awaits you O God in Zion to you our vows will be fulfilled.
O you who hear prayer to you all men will come.
When we were overwhelmed by sins you forgave our transgressions.
Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house of your holy temple.
You answer us with awesome deeds of righteousness O God our Savior the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas
who formed the mountains by your power having armed yourself with strength
who stilled the roaring of the seas the roaring of their waves and the turmoil of the nations.
Those living far away fear your wonders where morning dawns and evening fades you call forth songs of joy.
You care for the land and water it you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain for so you have ordained it.
You drench its furrows and level its ridges you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
You crown the year with your bounty and your carts overflow with abundance.
The grasslands of the desert overflow the hills are clothed with gladness.
The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain they shout for joy and sing.
Shout with joy to God all the earth!
Sing the glory of his name make his praise glorious!
Say to God How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.
All the earth bows down to you they sing praise to you they sing praise to your name. Selah
Come and see what God has done how awesome his works in mans behalf!
He turned the sea into dry land they passed through the waters on foot come let us rejoice in him.
May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine upon us Selah
that your ways may be known on earth your salvation among all nations.
May the peoples praise you O God may all the peoples praise you.
May the nations be glad and sing for joy for you rule the peoples justly and guide the nations of the earth. Selah
May the peoples praise you O God may all the peoples praise you.
Then the land will yield its harvest and God our God will bless us.
God will bless us and all the ends of the earth will fear him.
May God arise may his enemies be scattered may his foes flee before him.
As smoke is blown away by the wind may you blow them away as wax melts before the fire may the wicked perish before God.
But may the righteous be glad and rejoice before God may they be happy and joyful.
Sing to God sing praise to his name extol him who rides on the clouds his name is the Lord and rejoice before him.
A father to the fatherless a defender of widows is God in his holy dwelling.
God sets the lonely in families he leads forth the prisoners with singing but the rebellious live in a sunscorched land.
When you went out before your people O God when you marched through the wasteland Selah
the earth shook the heavens poured down rain before God the One of Sinai before God the God of Israel.
You gave abundant showers O God you refreshed your weary inheritance.
Your people settled in it and from your bounty O God you provided for the poor.
The Lord announced the word and great was the company of those who proclaimed it
Kings and armies flee in haste in the camps men divide the plunder.
Even while you sleep among the campfires the wings of my dove are sheathed with silver its feathers with shining gold.
When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land it was like snow fallen on Zalmon.
The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains rugged are the mountains of Bashan.
Why gaze in envy O rugged mountains at the mountain where God chooses to reign where the Lord himself will dwell forever?
The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands the Lord has come from Sinai into his sanctuary.
When you ascended on high you led captives in your train you received gifts from men even from the rebellious that you O Lord God might dwell there.
Praise be to the Lord to God our Savior who daily bears our burdens. Selah
Our God is a God who saves from the Sovereign Lord comes escape from death.
Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.
The Lord says I will bring them from Bashan I will bring them from the depths of the sea
that you may plunge your feet in the blood of your foes while the tongues of your dogs have their share.
Your procession has come into view O God the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.
In front are the singers after them the musicians with them are the maidens playing tambourines.
Praise God in the great congregation praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel.
There is the little tribe of Benjamin leading them there the great throng of Judahs princes and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.
Summon your power O God show us your strength O God as you have done before.
Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts.
Rebuke the beast among the reeds the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.
Envoys will come from Egypt Cush will submit herself to God.
Sing to God O kingdoms of the earth sing praise to the Lord Selah
to him who rides the ancient skies above who thunders with mighty voice.
Proclaim the power of God whose majesty is over Israel whose power is in the skies.
You are awesome O God in your sanctuary the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!
Save me O God for the waters have come up to my neck.
I sink in the miry depths where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters the floods engulf me.
I am worn out calling for help my throat is parched. My eyes fail looking for my God.
Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head many are my enemies without cause those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.
Hasten O God to save me O Lord come quickly to help me.
May those who seek my life be put to shame and confusion may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
May those who say to me Aha! Aha! turn back because of their shame.
But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you may those who love your salvation always say Let God be exalted!
Yet I am poor and needy come quickly to me O God. You are my help and my deliverer O Lord do not delay.
In you O Lord I have taken refuge let me never be put to shame.
Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness turn your ear to me and save me.
Be my rock of refuge to which I can always go give the command to save me for you are my rock and my fortress.
Deliver me O my God from the hand of the wicked from the grasp of evil and cruel men.
For you have been my hope O Sovereign Lord my confidence since my youth.
From birth I have relied on you you brought me forth from my mothers womb. I will ever praise you.
I have become like a portent to many but you are my strong refuge.
My mouth is filled with your praise declaring your splendor all day long.
Do not cast me away when I am old do not forsake me when my strength is gone.
For my enemies speak against me those who wait to kill me conspire together.
They say God has forsaken him pursue him and seize him for no one will rescue him.
Be not far from me O God come quickly O my God to help me.
May my accusers perish in shame may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.
But as for me I will always have hope I will praise you more and more.
My mouth will tell of your righteousness of your salvation all day long though I know not its measure.
I will come and proclaim your mighty acts O Sovereign Lord I will proclaim your righteousness yours alone.
Since my youth O God you have taught me and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
Even when I am old and gray do not forsake me O God till I declare your power to the next generation your might to all who are to come.
Your righteousness reaches to the skies O God you who have done great things. Who O God is like you?
Endow the king with your justice O God the royal son with your righteousness.
He will judge your people in righteousness your afflicted ones with justice.
The mountains will bring prosperity to the people the hills the fruit of righteousness.
He will defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy he will crush the oppressor.
He will endure as long as the sun as long as the moon through all generations.
He will be like rain falling on a mown field like showers watering the earth.
In his days the righteous will flourish prosperity will abound till the moon is no more.
He will rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
The desert tribes will bow before him and his enemies will lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of distant shores will bring tribute to him the kings of Sheba and Seba will present him gifts.
All kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him.
For he will deliver the needy who cry out the afflicted who have no one to help.
He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.
He will rescue them from oppression and violence for precious is their blood in his sight.
Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.
Let grain abound throughout the land on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let its fruit flourish like Lebanon let it thrive like the grass of the field.
May his name endure forever may it continue as long as the sun. All nations will be blessed through him and they will call him blessed.
Praise be to the Lord God the God of Israel who alone does marvelous deeds.
Praise be to his glorious name forever may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
Surely God is good to Israel to those who are pure in heart.
But as for me my feet had almost slipped I had nearly lost my foothold.
For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
They have no struggles their bodies are healthy and strong.
They are free from the burdens common to man they are not plagued by human ills.
Therefore pride is their necklace they clothe themselves with violence.
From their callous hearts comes iniquity the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.
They scoff and speak with malice in their arrogance they threaten oppression.
Their mouths lay claim to heaven and their tongues take possession of the earth.
Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.
They say How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?
This is what the wicked are like always carefree they increase in wealth.
Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.
All day long I have been plagued I have been punished every morning.
If I had said I will speak thus I would have betrayed your children.
When I tried to understand all this it was oppressive to me
till I entered the sanctuary of God then I understood their final destiny.
Surely you place them on slippery ground you cast them down to ruin.
How suddenly are they destroyed completely swept away by terrors!
As a dream when one awakes so when you arise O Lord you will despise them as fantasies.
When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered
I was senseless and ignorant I was a brute beast before you.
Why have you rejected us forever O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
Remember the people you purchased of old the tribe of your inheritance whom you redeemed Mount Zion where you dwelt.
Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.
Your foes roared in the place where you met with us they set up their standards as signs.
They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.
They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.
They burned your sanctuary to the ground they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.
They said in their hearts We will crush them completely! They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.
We are given no miraculous signs no prophets are left and none of us knows how long this will be.
We give thanks to you O God we give thanks for your Name is near men tell of your wonderful deeds.
You say I choose the appointed time it is I who judge uprightly.
When the earth and all its people quake it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah
To the arrogant I say Boast no more and to the wicked Do not lift up your horns.
Do not lift your horns against heaven do not speak with outstretched neck. 
No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man.
But it is God who judges He brings one down he exalts another.
In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices he pours it out and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.
As for me I will declare this forever I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
I will cut off the horns of all the wicked but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
In Judah God is known his name is great in Israel.
His tent is in Salem his dwelling place in Zion.
There he broke the flashing arrows the shields and the swords the weapons of war. Selah
You are resplendent with light more majestic than mountains rich with game.
Valiant men lie plundered they sleep their last sleep not one of the warriors can lift his hands.
At your rebuke O God of Jacob both horse and chariot lie still.
You alone are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?
From heaven you pronounced judgment and the land feared and was quiet
when you O God rose up to judge to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah
Surely your wrath against men brings you praise and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.
Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.
He breaks the spirit of rulers he is feared by the kings of the earth.
I cried out to God for help I cried out to God to hear me.
When I was in distress I sought the Lord at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered you O God and I groaned I mused and my spirit grew faint. Selah
You kept my eyes from closing I was too troubled to speak.
I thought about the former days the years of long ago
I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired
Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?
Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?
Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion? Selah
Then I thought To this I will appeal the years of the right hand of the Most High.
I will remember the deeds of the Lord yes I will remember your miracles of long ago.
I will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds.
Your ways O God are holy. What god is so great as our God?
You are the God who performs miracles you display your power among the peoples.
With your mighty arm you redeemed your people the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
The waters saw you O God the waters saw you and writhed the very depths were convulsed.
The clouds poured down water the skies resounded with thunder your arrows flashed back and forth.
Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind your lightning lit up the world the earth trembled and quaked.
Your path led through the sea your way through the mighty waters though your footprints were not seen.
You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
O my people hear my teaching listen to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in parables I will utter hidden things things from of old
what we have heard and known what our fathers have told us.
We will not hide them from their children we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord his power and the wonders he has done.
He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children
so the next generation would know them even the children yet to be born and they in turn would tell their children.
Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.
They would not be like their forefathers a stubborn and rebellious generation whose hearts were not loyal to God whose spirits were not faithful to him.
The men of Ephraim though armed with bows turned back on the day of battle
they did not keep Gods covenant and refused to live by his law.
They forgot what he had done the wonders he had shown them.
He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt in the region of Zoan.
O God the nations have invaded your inheritance they have defiled your holy temple they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.
They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.
They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem and there is no one to bury the dead.
We are objects of reproach to our neighbors of scorn and derision to those around us.
How long O Lord? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you on the kingdoms that do not call on your name
for they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his homeland.
Do not hold against us the sins of the fathers may your mercy come quickly to meet us for we are in desperate need.
Help us O God our Savior for the glory of your name deliver us and forgive our sins for your names sake.
Why should the nations say Where is their God? Before our eyes make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.
May the groans of the prisoners come before you by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die.
Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you O Lord.
Then we your people the sheep of your pasture will praise you forever from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
Hear us O Shepherd of Israel you who lead Joseph like a flock you who sit enthroned between the cherubim shine forth
before Ephraim Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might come and save us.
Restore us O God make your face shine upon us that we may be saved.
O Lord God Almighty how long will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?
You have fed them with the bread of tears you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.
You have made us a source of contention to our neighbors and our enemies mock us.
Restore us O God Almighty make your face shine upon us that we may be saved.
You brought a vine out of Egypt you drove out the nations and planted it.
You cleared the ground for it and it took root and filled the land.
The mountains were covered with its shade the mighty cedars with its branches.
It sent out its boughs to the Sea its shoots as far as the River.
Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?
Boars from the forest ravage it and the creatures of the field feed on it.
Return to us O God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine
the root your right hand has planted the son you have raised up for yourself.
Sing for joy to God our strength shout aloud to the God of Jacob!
Begin the music strike the tambourine play the melodious harp and lyre.
Sound the rams horn at the New Moon and when the moon is full on the day of our Feast
this is a decree for Israel an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
He established it as a statute for Joseph when he went out against Egypt where we heard a language we did not understand.
He says I removed the burden from their shoulders their hands were set free from the basket.
In your distress you called and I rescued you I answered you out of a thundercloud I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
God presides in the great assembly he gives judgment among the gods
How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
Rescue the weak and needy deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
They know nothing they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I said You are gods you are all sons of the Most High.
But you will die like mere men you will fall like every other ruler.
Rise up O God judge the earth for all the nations are your inheritance.
O God do not keep silent be not quiet O God be not still.
See how your enemies are astir how your foes rear their heads.
With cunning they conspire against your people they plot against those you cherish.
Come they say let us destroy them as a nation that the name of Israel be remembered no more.
With one mind they plot together they form an alliance against you
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites of Moab and the Hagrites
Gebal Ammon and Amalek Philistia with the people of Tyre.
Even Assyria has joined them to lend strength to the descendants of Lot. Selah
Do to them as you did to Midian as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon
who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna
How lovely is your dwelling place O Lord Almighty!
My soul yearns even faints for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
Even the sparrow has found a home and the swallow a nest for herself where she may have her young a place near your altar O Lord Almighty my King and my God.
Blessed are those who dwell in your house they are ever praising you. Selah
Blessed are those whose strength is in you who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.
As they pass through the Valley of Baca they make it a place of springs the autumn rains also cover it with pools.
They go from strength to strength till each appears before God in Zion.
Hear my prayer O Lord God Almighty listen to me O God of Jacob. Selah
Look upon our shield O God look with favor on your anointed one.
Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
For the Lord God is a sun and shield the Lord bestows favor and honor no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.
O Lord Almighty blessed is the man who trusts in you.
You showed favor to your land O Lord you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins. Selah
You set aside all your wrath and turned from your fierce anger.
Restore us again O God our Savior and put away your displeasure toward us.
Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations?
Will you not revive us again that your people may rejoice in you?
Show us your unfailing love O Lord and grant us your salvation.
I will listen to what God the Lord will say he promises peace to his people his saints but let them not return to folly.
Surely his salvation is near those who fear him that his glory may dwell in our land.
Love and faithfulness meet together righteousness and peace kiss each other.
Faithfulness springs forth from the earth and righteousness looks down from heaven.
The Lord will indeed give what is good and our land will yield its harvest.
Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.
Hear O Lord and answer me for I am poor and needy.
Guard my life for I am devoted to you. You are my God save your servant who trusts in you.
Have mercy on me O Lord for I call to you all day long.
Bring joy to your servant for to you O Lord I lift up my soul.
You are forgiving and good O Lord abounding in love to all who call to you.
Hear my prayer O Lord listen to my cry for mercy.
He has set his foundation on the holy mountain
the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are said of you O city of God Selah
I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me Philistia too and Tyre along with Cush and will say This one was born in Zion. 
Indeed of Zion it will be said This one and that one were born in her and the Most High himself will establish her.
The Lord will write in the register of the peoples This one was born in Zion. Selah
As they make music they will sing All my fountains are in you.
O Lord the God who saves me day and night I cry out before you.
May my prayer come before you turn your ear to my cry.
For my soul is full of trouble and my life draws near the grave.
I am counted among those who go down to the pit I am like a man without strength.
I am set apart with the dead like the slain who lie in the grave whom you remember no more who are cut off from your care.
You have put me in the lowest pit in the darkest depths.
Your wrath lies heavily upon me you have overwhelmed me with all your waves. Selah
You have taken from me my closest friends and have made me repulsive to them. I am confined and cannot escape
my eyes are dim with grief. I call to you O Lord every day I spread out my hands to you.
Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do those who are dead rise up and praise you? Selah
Is your love declared in the grave your faithfulness in Destruction?
Are your wonders known in the place of darkness or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?
But I cry to you for help O Lord in the morning my prayer comes before you.
Why O Lord do you reject me and hide your face from me?
From my youth I have been afflicted and close to death I have suffered your terrors and am in despair.
Your wrath has swept over me your terrors have destroyed me.
All day long they surround me like a flood they have completely engulfed me.
You have taken my companions and loved ones from me the darkness is my closest friend.
I will sing of the Lords great love forever with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.
I will declare that your love stands firm forever that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself.
You said I have made a covenant with my chosen one I have sworn to David my servant
I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.  Selah
The heavens praise your wonders O Lord your faithfulness too in the assembly of the holy ones.
For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?
In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared he is more awesome than all who surround him.
O Lord God Almighty who is like you? You are mighty O Lord and your faithfulness surrounds you.
You rule over the surging sea when its waves mount up you still them.
You crushed Rahab like one of the slain with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
The heavens are yours and yours also the earth you founded the world and all that is in it.
You created the north and the south Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.
Your arm is endued with power your hand is strong your right hand exalted.
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne love and faithfulness go before you.
Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you who walk in the light of your presence O Lord.
They rejoice in your name all day long they exult in your righteousness.
Lord you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.
Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
You turn men back to dust saying Return to dust O sons of men.
For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by or like a watch in the night.
You sweep men away in the sleep of death they are like the new grass of the morning
though in the morning it springs up new by evening it is dry and withered.
We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.
You have set our iniquities before you our secret sins in the light of your presence.
All our days pass away under your wrath we finish our years with a moan.
The length of our days is seventy years or eighty if we have the strength yet their span is but trouble and sorrow for they quickly pass and we fly away.
Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.
Teach us to number our days aright that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
Relent O Lord! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.
Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us for as many years as we have seen trouble.
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of the Lord He is my refuge and my fortress my God in whom I trust.
Surely he will save you from the fowlers snare and from the deadly pestilence.
He will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you will find refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
You will not fear the terror of night nor the arrow that flies by day
nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness nor the plague that destroys at midday.
A thousand may fall at your side ten thousand at your right hand but it will not come near you.
You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.
If you make the Most High your dwelling even the Lord who is my refuge
then no harm will befall you no disaster will come near your tent.
For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways
they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
You will tread upon the lion and the cobra you will trample the great lion and the serpent.
Because he loves me says the Lord I will rescue him I will protect him for he acknowledges my name.
It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name O Most High
to proclaim your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night
to the music of the tenstringed lyre and the melody of the harp.
For you make me glad by your deeds O Lord I sing for joy at the works of your hands.
The Lord reigns he is robed in majesty the Lord is robed in majesty and is armed with strength. The world is firmly established it cannot be moved.
Your throne was established long ago you are from all eternity.
The seas have lifted up O Lord the seas have lifted up their voice the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
Mightier than the thunder of the great waters mightier than the breakers of the sea the Lord on high is mighty.
Your statutes stand firm holiness adorns your house for endless days O Lord.
O Lord the God who avenges O God who avenges shine forth.
Rise up O Judge of the earth pay back to the proud what they deserve.
How long will the wicked O Lord how long will the wicked be jubilant?
They pour out arrogant words all the evildoers are full of boasting.
They crush your people O Lord they oppress your inheritance.
They slay the widow and the alien they murder the fatherless.
They say The Lord does not see the God of Jacob pays no heed.
Take heed you senseless ones among the people you fools when will you become wise?
Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see?
Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge?
Come let us sing for joy to the Lord let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.
For the Lord is the great God the great King above all gods.
In his hand are the depths of the earth and the mountain peaks belong to him.
The sea is his for he made it and his hands formed the dry land.
Come let us bow down in worship let us kneel before the Lord our Maker
for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture the flock under his care. Today if you hear his voice
do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah as you did that day at Massah in the desert
where your fathers tested and tried me though they had seen what I did.
For forty years I was angry with that generation I said They are a people whose hearts go astray and they have not known my ways.
So I declared on oath in my anger They shall never enter my rest.
Sing to the Lord a new song sing to the Lord all the earth.
Sing to the Lord praise his name proclaim his salvation day after day.
Declare his glory among the nations his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise he is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are idols but the Lord made the heavens.
Splendor and majesty are before him strength and glory are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe to the Lord O families of nations ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name bring an offering and come into his courts.
Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness tremble before him all the earth.
Say among the nations The Lord reigns. The world is firmly established it cannot be moved he will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens rejoice let the earth be glad let the sea resound and all that is in it
The Lord reigns let the earth be glad let the distant shores rejoice.
Clouds and thick darkness surround him righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side.
His lightning lights up the world the earth sees and trembles.
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord before the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens proclaim his righteousness and all the peoples see his glory.
All who worship images are put to shame those who boast in idols worship him all you gods!
Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments O Lord.
Sing to the Lord a new song for he has done marvelous things his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
The Lord has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to the house of Israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Shout for joy to the Lord all the earth burst into jubilant song with music
make music to the Lord with the harp with the harp and the sound of singing
with trumpets and the blast of the rams horn shout for joy before the Lord the King.
Let the sea resound and everything in it the world and all who live in it.
Let the rivers clap their hands let the mountains sing together for joy
let them sing before the Lord for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.
The Lord reigns let the nations tremble he sits enthroned between the cherubim let the earth shake.
Great is the Lord in Zion he is exalted over all the nations.
Let them praise your great and awesome name he is holy.
The King is mighty he loves justice you have established equity in Jacob you have done what is just and right.
Shout for joy to the Lord all the earth.
Worship the Lord with gladness come before him with joyful songs.
Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us and we are his we are his people the sheep of his pasture.
Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise give thanks to him and praise his name.
For the Lord is good and his love endures forever his faithfulness continues through all generations.
I will sing of your love and justice to you O Lord I will sing praise.
I will be careful to lead a blameless life when will you come to me? I will walk in my house with blameless heart.
I will set before my eyes no vile thing. The deeds of faithless men I hate they will not cling to me.
Men of perverse heart shall be far from me I will have nothing to do with evil.
Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret him will I put to silence whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart him will I not endure.
My eyes will be on the faithful in the land that they may dwell with me he whose walk is blameless will minister to me.
No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.
Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the Lord.
Hear my prayer O Lord let my cry for help come to you.
Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me when I call answer me quickly.
For my days vanish like smoke my bones burn like glowing embers.
My heart is blighted and withered like grass I forget to eat my food.
Because of my loud groaning I am reduced to skin and bones.
I am like a desert owl like an owl among the ruins.
I lie awake I have become like a bird alone on a roof.
All day long my enemies taunt me those who rail against me use my name as a curse.
For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears
because of your great wrath for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.
My days are like the evening shadow I wither away like grass.
But you O Lord sit enthroned forever your renown endures through all generations.
You will arise and have compassion on Zion for it is time to show favor to her the appointed time has come.
For her stones are dear to your servants her very dust moves them to pity.
The nations will fear the name of the Lord all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.
For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.
He will respond to the prayer of the destitute he will not despise their plea.
Let this be written for a future generation that a people not yet created may praise the Lord
The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high from heaven he viewed the earth
to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.
So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem
Praise the Lord O my soul all my inmost being praise his holy name.
Praise the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits
who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases
who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion
who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagles.
The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
He made known his ways to Moses his deeds to the people of Israel
The Lord is compassionate and gracious slow to anger abounding in love.
He will not always accuse nor will he harbor his anger forever
he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
For as high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love for those who fear him
as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
As a father has compassion on his children so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him
for he knows how we are formed he remembers that we are dust.
As for man his days are like grass he flourishes like a flower of the field
the wind blows over it and it is gone and its place remembers it no more.
But from everlasting to everlasting the Lords love is with those who fear him and his righteousness with their childrens children
with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.
The Lord has established his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all.
Praise the Lord you his angels you mighty ones who do his bidding who obey his word.
Praise the Lord all his heavenly hosts you his servants who do his will.
Praise the Lord all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the Lord O my soul.
Praise the Lord O my soul. O Lord my God you are very great you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
He wraps himself in light as with a garment he stretches out the heavens like a tent
and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.
He makes winds his messengers flames of fire his servants.
He set the earth on its foundations it can never be moved.
You covered it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountains.
But at your rebuke the waters fled at the sound of your thunder they took to flight
they flowed over the mountains they went down into the valleys to the place you assigned for them.
You set a boundary they cannot cross never again will they cover the earth.
He makes springs pour water into the ravines it flows between the mountains.
They give water to all the beasts of the field the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
The birds of the air nest by the waters they sing among the branches.
He waters the mountains from his upper chambers the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.
He makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for man to cultivate bringing forth food from the earth
wine that gladdens the heart of man oil to make his face shine and bread that sustains his heart.
The trees of the Lord are well watered the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
There the birds make their nests the stork has its home in the pine trees.
The high mountains belong to the wild goats the crags are a refuge for the coneys.
The moon marks off the seasons and the sun knows when to go down.
You bring darkness it becomes night and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
The sun rises and they steal away they return and lie down in their dens.
Then man goes out to his work to his labor until evening.
How many are your works O Lord! In wisdom you made them all the earth is full of your creatures.
There is the sea vast and spacious teeming with creatures beyond number living things both large and small.
There the ships go to and fro and the leviathan which you formed to frolic there.
These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.
When you give it to them they gather it up when you open your hand they are satisfied with good things.
When you hide your face they are terrified when you take away their breath they die and return to the dust.
When you send your Spirit they are created and you renew the face of the earth.
May the glory of the Lord endure forever may the Lord rejoice in his works
he who looks at the earth and it trembles who touches the mountains and they smoke.
I will sing to the Lord all my life I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
May my meditation be pleasing to him as I rejoice in the Lord.
But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the Lord O my soul. Praise the Lord.
Give thanks to the Lord call on his name make known among the nations what he has done.
Sing to him sing praise to him tell of all his wonderful acts.
Glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
Look to the Lord and his strength seek his face always.
Remember the wonders he has done his miracles and the judgments he pronounced
O descendants of Abraham his servant O sons of Jacob his chosen ones.
He is the Lord our God his judgments are in all the earth.
He remembers his covenant forever the word he commanded for a thousand generations
the covenant he made with Abraham the oath he swore to Isaac.
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree to Israel as an everlasting covenant
To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.
When they were but few in number few indeed and strangers in it
they wandered from nation to nation from one kingdom to another.
He allowed no one to oppress them for their sake he rebuked kings
Do not touch my anointed ones do my prophets no harm.
He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food
and he sent a man before them Joseph sold as a slave.
They bruised his feet with shackles his neck was put in irons
till what he foretold came to pass till the word of the Lord proved him true.
The king sent and released him the ruler of peoples set him free.
He made him master of his household ruler over all he possessed
to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
Then Israel entered Egypt Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.
The Lord made his people very fruitful he made them too numerous for their foes
whose hearts he turned to hate his people to conspire against his servants.
He sent Moses his servant and Aaron whom he had chosen.
They performed his miraculous signs among them his wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness and made the land dark for had they not rebelled against his words?
He turned their waters into blood causing their fish to die.
Their land teemed with frogs which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.
He spoke and there came swarms of flies and gnats throughout their country.
He turned their rain into hail with lightning throughout their land
he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
He spoke and the locusts came grasshoppers without number
they ate up every green thing in their land ate up the produce of their soil.
Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land the firstfruits of all their manhood.
He brought out Israel laden with silver and gold and from among their tribes no one faltered.
Egypt was glad when they left because dread of Israel had fallen on them.
He spread out a cloud as a covering and a fire to give light at night.
They asked and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock and water gushed out like a river it flowed in the desert.
For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.
He brought out his people with rejoicing his chosen ones with shouts of joy
he gave them the lands of the nations and they fell heir to what others had toiled for
that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord. Give thanks to the Lord for he is good his love endures forever.
Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord or fully declare his praise?
Blessed are they who maintain justice who constantly do what is right.
Remember me O Lord when you show favor to your people come to my aid when you save them
that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.
We have sinned even as our fathers did we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
When our fathers were in Egypt they gave no thought to your miracles they did not remember your many kindnesses and they rebelled by the sea the Red Sea.
Yet he saved them for his names sake to make his mighty power known.
He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried up he led them through the depths as through a desert.
He saved them from the hand of the foe from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.
The waters covered their adversaries not one of them survived.
Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.
But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.
In the desert they gave in to their craving in the wasteland they put God to the test.
So he gave them what they asked for but sent a wasting disease upon them.
In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron who was consecrated to the Lord.
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan it buried the company of Abiram.
Fire blazed among their followers a flame consumed the wicked.
At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.
They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull which eats grass.
They forgot the God who saved them who had done great things in Egypt
miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
So he said he would destroy them had not Moses his chosen one stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.
Then they despised the pleasant land they did not believe his promise.
They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the Lord.
So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert
make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods
they provoked the Lord to anger by their wicked deeds and a plague broke out among them.
But Phinehas stood up and intervened and the plague was checked.
This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord and trouble came to Moses because of them
for they rebelled against the Spirit of God and rash words came from Moses lips.
They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them
but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
They worshiped their idols which became a snare to them.
They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
They shed innocent blood the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan and the land was desecrated by their blood.
They defiled themselves by what they did by their deeds they prostituted themselves.
Therefore the Lord was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.
He handed them over to the nations and their foes ruled over them.
Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.
Give thanks to the Lord for he is good his love endures forever.
Let the redeemed of the Lord say this those he redeemed from the hand of the foe
those he gathered from the lands from east and west from north and south.
Some wandered in desert wastelands finding no way to a city where they could settle.
They were hungry and thirsty and their lives ebbed away.
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them from their distress.
He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.
Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men
for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.
Some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom prisoners suffering in iron chains
for they had rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.
So he subjected them to bitter labor they stumbled and there was no one to help.
My heart is steadfast O God I will sing and make music with all my soul.
Awake harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
I will praise you O Lord among the nations I will sing of you among the peoples.
For great is your love higher than the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
Be exalted O God above the heavens and let your glory be over all the earth.
Save us and help us with your right hand that those you love may be delivered.
God has spoken from his sanctuary In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine Manasseh is mine Ephraim is my helmet Judah my scepter.
Moab is my washbasin upon Edom I toss my sandal over Philistia I shout in triumph.
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Is it not you O God you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?
Give us aid against the enemy for the help of man is worthless.
With God we will gain the victory and he will trample down our enemies.
O God whom I praise do not remain silent
for wicked and deceitful men have opened their mouths against me they have spoken against me with lying tongues.
With words of hatred they surround me they attack me without cause.
In return for my friendship they accuse me but I am a man of prayer.
They repay me evil for good and hatred for my friendship.
Appoint an evil man to oppose him let an accuser stand at his right hand.
The Lord says to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion you will rule in the midst of your enemies.
Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy majesty from the womb of the dawn you will receive the dew of your youth.
The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord is at your right hand he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.
He will judge the nations heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.
He will drink from a brook beside the way therefore he will lift up his head.
Praise the Lord. I will extol the Lord with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.
Great are the works of the Lord they are pondered by all who delight in them.
Glorious and majestic are his deeds and his righteousness endures forever.
He has caused his wonders to be remembered the Lord is gracious and compassionate.
He provides food for those who fear him he remembers his covenant forever.

The works of his hands are faithful and just all his precepts are trustworthy.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.
Praise the Lord. Blessed is the man who fears the Lord who finds great delight in his commands.
His children will be mighty in the land the generation of the upright will be blessed.
Wealth and riches are in his house and his righteousness endures forever.
Even in darkness light dawns for the upright for the gracious and compassionate and righteous man.
Good will come to him who is generous and lends freely who conducts his affairs with justice.
Surely he will never be shaken a righteous man will be remembered forever.
He will have no fear of bad news his heart is steadfast trusting in the Lord.

Praise the Lord. Praise O servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord.
Let the name of the Lord be praised both now and forevermore.
From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets the name of the Lord is to be praised.
The Lord is exalted over all the nations his glory above the heavens.
Who is like the Lord our God the One who sits enthroned on high
who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?
He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap
When Israel came out of Egypt the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue
Judah became Gods sanctuary Israel his dominion.
The sea looked and fled the Jordan turned back
the mountains skipped like rams the hills like lambs.
Why was it O sea that you fled O Jordan that you turned back
you mountains that you skipped like rams you hills like lambs?
Tremble O earth at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the God of Jacob
who turned the rock into a pool the hard rock into springs of water.
Not to us O Lord not to us but to your name be the glory because of your love and faithfulness.
Why do the nations say Where is their God?
Our God is in heaven he does whatever pleases him.
But their idols are silver and gold made by the hands of men.
They have mouths but cannot speak eyes but they cannot see
they have ears but cannot hear noses but they cannot smell
they have hands but cannot feel feet but they cannot walk nor can they utter a sound with their throats.
Those who make them will be like them and so will all who trust in them.
O house of Israel trust in the Lord he is their help and shield.
O house of Aaron trust in the Lord he is their help and shield.
You who fear him trust in the Lord he is their help and shield.
The Lord remembers us and will bless us He will bless the house of Israel he will bless the house of Aaron
he will bless those who fear the Lord small and great alike.
May the Lord make you increase both you and your children.
May you be blessed by the Lord the Maker of heaven and earth.
The highest heavens belong to the Lord but the earth he has given to man.
It is not the dead who praise the Lord those who go down to silence
it is we who extol the Lord both now and forevermore. Praise the Lord.
I love the Lord for he heard my voice he heard my cry for mercy.
Praise the Lord all you nations extol him all you peoples.
For great is his love toward us and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. Praise the Lord.
Give thanks to the Lord for he is good his love endures forever.
Let Israel say His love endures forever.
Let the house of Aaron say His love endures forever.
Let those who fear the Lord say His love endures forever.
In my anguish I cried to the Lord and he answered by setting me free.
The Lord is with me I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
The Lord is with me he is my helper. I will look in triumph on my enemies.
It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man.
It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes.
All the nations surrounded me but in the name of the Lord I cut them off.
They surrounded me on every side but in the name of the Lord I cut them off.
They swarmed around me like bees but they died out as quickly as burning thorns in the name of the Lord I cut them off.
I was pushed back and about to fall but the Lord helped me.
The Lord is my strength and my song he has become my salvation.
Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous The Lords right hand has done mighty things!
The Lords right hand is lifted high the Lords right hand has done mighty things!
I will not die but live and will proclaim what the Lord has done.
The Lord has chastened me severely but he has not given me over to death.
Open for me the gates of righteousness I will enter and give thanks to the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord through which the righteous may enter.
I will give you thanks for you answered me you have become my salvation.
The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone
the Lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes.
This is the day the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it.
O Lord save us O Lord grant us success.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. From the house of the Lord we bless you.
The Lord is God and he has made his light shine upon us. With boughs in hand join in the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.
You are my God and I will give you thanks you are my God and I will exalt you.
Give thanks to the Lord for he is good his love endures forever.
Blessed are they whose ways are blameless who walk according to the law of the Lord.
Blessed are they who keep his statutes and seek him with all their heart.
They do nothing wrong they walk in his ways.
You have laid down precepts that are to be fully obeyed.
Oh that my ways were steadfast in obeying your decrees!
Then I would not be put to shame when I consider all your commands.
I call on the Lord in my distress and he answers me.
Save me O Lord from lying lips and from deceitful tongues.
What will he do to you and what more besides O deceitful tongue?
He will punish you with a warriors sharp arrows with burning coals of the broom tree.
Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech that I live among the tents of Kedar!
Too long have I lived among those who hate peace.
I am a man of peace but when I speak they are for war.
I lift up my eyes to the hills where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord the Maker of heaven and earth.
He will not let your foot slip he who watches over you will not slumber
indeed he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord watches over you the Lord is your shade at your right hand
the sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night.
The Lord will keep you from all harm he will watch over your life
the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
I rejoiced with those who said to me Let us go to the house of the Lord.
Our feet are standing in your gates O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built like a city that is closely compacted together.
I lift up my eyes to you to you whose throne is in heaven.
As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master as the eyes of a maid look to the hand of her mistress so our eyes look to the Lord our God till he shows us his mercy.
Have mercy on us O Lord have mercy on us for we have endured much contempt.
We have endured much ridicule from the proud much contempt from the arrogant.
If the Lord had not been on our side let Israel say
if the Lord had not been on our side when men attacked us
when their anger flared against us they would have swallowed us alive
the flood would have engulfed us the torrent would have swept over us
Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion which cannot be shaken but endures forever.
As the mountains surround Jerusalem so the Lord surrounds his people both now and forevermore.
The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous for then the righteous might use their hands to do evil.
Do good O Lord to those who are good to those who are upright in heart.
But those who turn to crooked ways the Lord will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion we were like men who dreamed.
Our mouths were filled with laughter our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations The Lord has done great things for them.
The Lord has done great things for us and we are filled with joy.
Restore our fortunes O Lord like streams in the Negev.
Unless the Lord builds the house its builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city the watchmen stand guard in vain.
In vain you rise early and stay up late toiling for food to eat for he grants sleep to those he loves.
Sons are a heritage from the Lord children a reward from him.
Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in ones youth.
Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.
Blessed are all who fear the Lord who walk in his ways.
You will eat the fruit of your labor blessings and prosperity will be yours.
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house your sons will be like olive shoots around your table.
Thus is the man blessed who fears the Lord.
May the Lord bless you from Zion all the days of your life may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
and may you live to see your childrens children. Peace be upon Israel.
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth let Israel say
they have greatly oppressed me from my youth but they have not gained the victory over me.
Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.
But the Lord is righteous he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.
May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.
May they be like grass on the roof which withers before it can grow
with it the reaper cannot fill his hands nor the one who gathers fill his arms.
May those who pass by not say The blessing of the Lord be upon you we bless you in the name of the Lord.
Out of the depths I cry to you O Lord
O Lord hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
My heart is not proud O Lord my eyes are not haughty I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.
But I have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother like a weaned child is my soul within me.
O Israel put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.
O Lord remember David and all the hardships he endured.
He swore an oath to the Lord and made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob
I will not enter my house or go to my bed
How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!
It is like precious oil poured on the head running down on the beard running down on Aarons beard down upon the collar of his robes.
It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion. For there the Lord bestows his blessing even life forevermore.
Praise the Lord all you servants of the Lord who minister by night in the house of the Lord.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and praise the Lord.
May the Lord the Maker of heaven and earth bless you from Zion.
Praise the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord praise him you servants of the Lord
you who minister in the house of the Lord in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise the Lord for the Lord is good sing praise to his name for that is pleasant.
For the Lord has chosen Jacob to be his own Israel to be his treasured possession.
I know that the Lord is great that our Lord is greater than all gods.
The Lord does whatever pleases him in the heavens and on the earth in the seas and all their depths.
He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt the firstborn of men and animals.
He sent his signs and wonders into your midst O Egypt against Pharaoh and all his servants.
He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings
Sihon king of the Amorites Og king of Bashan and all the kings of Canaan
and he gave their land as an inheritance an inheritance to his people Israel.
Your name O Lord endures forever your renown O Lord through all generations.
For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold made by the hands of men.
They have mouths but cannot speak eyes but they cannot see
they have ears but cannot hear nor is there breath in their mouths.
Those who make them will be like them and so will all who trust in them.
O house of Israel praise the Lord O house of Aaron praise the Lord
O house of Levi praise the Lord you who fear him praise the Lord.
Praise be to the Lord from Zion to him who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.

who by his understanding made the heavens His love endures forever.
who spread out the earth upon the waters His love endures forever.
who made the great lights His love endures forever.
the sun to govern the day His love endures forever.
By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.
There on the poplars we hung our harps
for there our captors asked us for songs our tormentors demanded songs of joy they said Sing us one of the songs of Zion!
How can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a foreign land?
If I forget you O Jerusalem may my right hand forget its skill.
May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.
Remember O Lord what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell. Tear it down they cried tear it down to its foundations!
I will praise you O Lord with all my heart before the gods I will sing your praise.
I will bow down toward your holy temple and will praise your name for your love and your faithfulness for you have exalted above all things your name and your word.
When I called you answered me you made me bold and stouthearted.
May all the kings of the earth praise you O Lord when they hear the words of your mouth.
May they sing of the ways of the Lord for the glory of the Lord is great.
Though the Lord is on high he looks upon the lowly but the proud he knows from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble you preserve my life you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes with your right hand you save me.
The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me your love O Lord endures forever do not abandon the works of your hands.
O Lord you have searched me and you know me.
You know when I sit and when I rise you perceive my thoughts from afar.
You discern my going out and my lying down you are familiar with all my ways.
Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely O Lord.
You hem me inbehind and before you have laid your hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me too lofty for me to attain.
Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?
If I go up to the heavens you are there if I make my bed in the depths you are there.
If I rise on the wings of the dawn if I settle on the far side of the sea
even there your hand will guide me your right hand will hold me fast.
If I say Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me
even the darkness will not be dark to you the night will shine like the day for darkness is as light to you.
Rescue me O Lord from evil men protect me from men of violence
who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.
They make their tongues as sharp as a serpents the poison of vipers is on their lips. Selah
Keep me O Lord from the hands of the wicked protect me from men of violence who plan to trip my feet.
Proud men have hidden a snare for me they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path. Selah
O Lord I say to you You are my God. Hear O Lord my cry for mercy.
O Sovereign Lord my strong deliverer who shields my head in the day of battle
do not grant the wicked their desires O Lord do not let their plans succeed or they will become proud. Selah
Let the heads of those who surround me be covered with the trouble their lips have caused.
O Lord I call to you come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to you.
May my prayer be set before you like incense may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.
Set a guard over my mouth O Lord keep watch over the door of my lips.
Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers let me not eat of their delicacies.
Let a righteous man strike meit is a kindness let him rebuke meit is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers
their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.
I cry aloud to the Lord I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.
I pour out my complaint before him before him I tell my trouble.
When my spirit grows faint within me it is you who know my way. In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me.
Look to my right and see no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge no one cares for my life.
I cry to you O Lord I say You are my refuge my portion in the land of the living.
Listen to my cry for I am in desperate need rescue me from those who pursue me for they are too strong for me.
Set me free from my prison that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.
O Lord hear my prayer listen to my cry for mercy in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.
Do not bring your servant into judgment for no one living is righteous before you.
The enemy pursues me he crushes me to the ground he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead.
So my spirit grows faint within me my heart within me is dismayed.
I remember the days of long ago I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.
I spread out my hands to you my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah
Answer me quickly O Lord my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.
Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go for to you I lift up my soul.
Rescue me from my enemies O Lord for I hide myself in you.
Teach me to do your will for you are my God may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
For your names sake O Lord preserve my life in your righteousness bring me out of trouble.
In your unfailing love silence my enemies destroy all my foes for I am your servant.
Praise be to the Lord my Rock who trains my hands for war my fingers for battle.
He is my loving God and my fortress my stronghold and my deliverer my shield in whom I take refuge who subdues peoples under me.
O Lord what is man that you care for him the son of man that you think of him?
Man is like a breath his days are like a fleeting shadow.
Part your heavens O Lord and come down touch the mountains so that they smoke.
Send forth lightning and scatter the enemies shoot your arrows and rout them.
Reach down your hand from on high deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters from the hands of foreigners
whose mouths are full of lies whose right hands are deceitful.
I will sing a new song to you O God on the tenstringed lyre I will make music to you
to the One who gives victory to kings who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword.
Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies whose right hands are deceitful.
Then our sons in their youth will be like wellnurtured plants and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands by tens of thousands in our fields
our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls no going into captivity no cry of distress in our streets.
Blessed are the people of whom this is true blessed are the people whose God is the Lord.
I will exalt you my God the King I will praise your name for ever and ever.
Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise his greatness no one can fathom.
One generation will commend your works to another they will tell of your mighty acts.
They will speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty and I will meditate on your wonderful works.
They will tell of the power of your awesome works and I will proclaim your great deeds.
They will celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and compassionate slow to anger and rich in love.
The Lord is good to all he has compassion on all he has made.
Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord O my soul.
I will praise the Lord all my life I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
Do not put your trust in princes in mortal men who cannot save.
When their spirit departs they return to the ground on that very day their plans come to nothing.
Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob whose hope is in the Lord his God
the Maker of heaven and earth the sea and everything in them the Lord who remains faithful forever.
He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free

The proverbs of Solomon son of David king of Israel
for attaining wisdom and discipline for understanding words of insight
for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life doing what is right and just and fair
for giving prudence to the simple knowledge and discretion to the young
let the wise listen and add to their learning and let the discerning get guidance
for understanding proverbs and parables the sayings and riddles of the wise.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
Listen my son to your fathers instruction and do not forsake your mothers teaching.
They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.
My son if sinners entice you do not give in to them.
If they say Come along with us lets lie in wait for someones blood lets waylay some harmless soul
lets swallow them alive like the grave and whole like those who go down to the pit
we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder
throw in your lot with us and we will share a common purse
my son do not go along with them do not set foot on their paths
for their feet rush into sin they are swift to shed blood.
How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!
These men lie in wait for their own blood they waylay only themselves!
Such is the end of all who go after illgotten gain it takes away the lives of those who get it.
Wisdom calls aloud in the street she raises her voice in the public squares
at the head of the noisy streets she cries out in the gateways of the city she makes her speech
My son if you accept my words and store up my commands within you
turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding
and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding
and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure
then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.
For the Lord gives wisdom and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
He holds victory in store for the upright he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless
for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.
Then you will understand what is right and just and fairevery good path.
For wisdom will enter your heart and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
Discretion will protect you and understanding will guard you.
Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men from men whose words are perverse
who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways
who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil
whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.
It will save you also from the adulteress from the wayward wife with her seductive words
who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.
For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.
Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.
For the upright will live in the land and the blameless will remain in it
but the wicked will be cut off from the land and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
My son do not forget my teaching but keep my commands in your heart
for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.
Let love and faithfulness never leave you bind them around your neck write them on the tablet of your heart.
Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding
in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight.
Do not be wise in your own eyes fear the Lord and shun evil.
This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.
Honor the Lord with your wealth with the firstfruits of all your crops
then your barns will be filled to overflowing and your vats will brim over with new wine.
My son do not despise the Lords discipline and do not resent his rebuke
because the Lord disciplines those he loves as a father the son he delights in.
Blessed is the man who finds wisdom the man who gains understanding
for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.
She is more precious than rubies nothing you desire can compare with her.
Long life is in her right hand in her left hand are riches and honor.
Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.
She is a tree of life to those who embrace her those who lay hold of her will be blessed.
By wisdom the Lord laid the earths foundations by understanding he set the heavens in place
by his knowledge the deeps were divided and the clouds let drop the dew.
My son preserve sound judgment and discernment do not let them out of your sight
they will be life for you an ornament to grace your neck.
Then you will go on your way in safety and your foot will not stumble
when you lie down you will not be afraid when you lie down your sleep will be sweet.
Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked
for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared.
Listen my sons to a fathers instruction pay attention and gain understanding.
I give you sound learning so do not forsake my teaching.
When I was a boy in my fathers house still tender and an only child of my mother
he taught me and said Lay hold of my words with all your heart keep my commands and you will live.
Get wisdom get understanding do not forget my words or swerve from them.
Do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you love her and she will watch over you.
Wisdom is supreme therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have get understanding.
Esteem her and she will exalt you embrace her and she will honor you.
She will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with a crown of splendor.
Listen my son accept what I say and the years of your life will be many.
I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.
When you walk your steps will not be hampered when you run you will not stumble.
Hold on to instruction do not let it go guard it well for it is your life.
Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men.
Avoid it do not travel on it turn from it and go on your way.
For they cannot sleep till they do evil they are robbed of slumber till they make someone fall.
They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn shining ever brighter till the full light of day.
But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness they do not know what makes them stumble.
My son pay attention to what I say listen closely to my words.
Do not let them out of your sight keep them within your heart
for they are life to those who find them and health to a mans whole body.
My son pay attention to my wisdom listen well to my words of insight
that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.
For the lips of an adulteress drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil
but in the end she is bitter as gall sharp as a doubleedged sword.
Her feet go down to death her steps lead straight to the grave.
She gives no thought to the way of life her paths are crooked but she knows it not.
Now then my sons listen to me do not turn aside from what I say.
Keep to a path far from her do not go near the door of her house
lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel
lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another mans house.
At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and body are spent.
You will say How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction!
I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors.
I have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.
Drink water from your own cistern running water from your own well.
Should your springs overflow in the streets your streams of water in the public squares?
Let them be yours alone never to be shared with strangers.
May your fountain be blessed and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
A loving doe a graceful deer may her breasts satisfy you always may you ever be captivated by her love.
Why be captivated my son by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another mans wife?
For a mans ways are in full view of the Lord and he examines all his paths.
The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him the cords of his sin hold him fast.
He will die for lack of discipline led astray by his own great folly.
My son if you have put up security for your neighbor if you have struck hands in pledge for another
if you have been trapped by what you said ensnared by the words of your mouth
then do this my son to free yourself since you have fallen into your neighbors hands Go and humble yourself press your plea with your neighbor!
Allow no sleep to your eyes no slumber to your eyelids.
Free yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
Go to the ant you sluggard consider its ways and be wise!
It has no commander no overseer or ruler
yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.
How long will you lie there you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?
A little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest
and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.
A scoundrel and villain who goes about with a corrupt mouth
who winks with his eye signals with his feet and motions with his fingers
who plots evil with deceit in his heart he always stirs up dissension.
Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant he will suddenly be destroyedwithout remedy.
There are six things the Lord hates seven that are detestable to him
haughty eyes a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood
a heart that devises wicked schemes feet that are quick to rush into evil
a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.
My son keep your fathers commands and do not forsake your mothers teaching.
Bind them upon your heart forever fasten them around your neck.
When you walk they will guide you when you sleep they will watch over you when you awake they will speak to you.
For these commands are a lamp this teaching is a light and the corrections of discipline are the way to life
keeping you from the immoral woman from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.
Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes
for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread and the adulteress preys upon your very life.
My son keep my words and store up my commands within you.
Keep my commands and you will live guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
Bind them on your fingers write them on the tablet of your heart.
Say to wisdom You are my sister and call understanding your kinsman
they will keep you from the adulteress from the wayward wife with her seductive words.
At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.
I saw among the simple I noticed among the young men a youth who lacked judgment.
He was going down the street near her corner walking along in the direction of her house
at twilight as the day was fading as the dark of night set in.
Then out came a woman to meet him dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.
(She is loud and defiant her feet never stay at home
now in the street now in the squares at every corner she lurks.)
She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said
I have fellowship offerings at home today I fulfilled my vows.
So I came out to meet you I looked for you and have found you!
I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon.
Come lets drink deep of love till morning lets enjoy ourselves with love!
My husband is not at home he has gone on a long journey.
He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon.
With persuasive words she led him astray she seduced him with her smooth talk.
All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter like a deer stepping into a noose
till an arrow pierces his liver like a bird darting into a snare little knowing it will cost him his life.
Now then my sons listen to me pay attention to what I say.
Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.
Many are the victims she has brought down her slain are a mighty throng.
Her house is a highway to the grave leading down to the chambers of death.
Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?
On the heights along the way where the paths meet she takes her stand
beside the gates leading into the city at the entrances she cries aloud
To you O men I call out I raise my voice to all mankind.
You who are simple gain prudence you who are foolish gain understanding.
Listen for I have worthy things to say I open my lips to speak what is right.
My mouth speaks what is true for my lips detest wickedness.
All the words of my mouth are just none of them is crooked or perverse.
To the discerning all of them are right they are faultless to those who have knowledge.
Choose my instruction instead of silver knowledge rather than choice gold
for wisdom is more precious than rubies and nothing you desire can compare with her.
I wisdom dwell together with prudence I possess knowledge and discretion.
To fear the Lord is to hate evil I hate pride and arrogance evil behavior and perverse speech.
Counsel and sound judgment are mine I have understanding and power.
By me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just
by me princes govern and all nobles who rule on earth.
I love those who love me and those who seek me find me.
Wisdom has built her house she has hewn out its seven pillars.
She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine she has also set her table.
She has sent out her maids and she calls from the highest point of the city.
Let all who are simple come in here! she says to those who lack judgment.
Come eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.
Leave your simple ways and you will live walk in the way of understanding.
Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse.
Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you rebuke a wise man and he will love you.
Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
For through me your days will be many and years will be added to your life.
If you are wise your wisdom will reward you if you are a mocker you alone will suffer.
The woman Folly is loud she is undisciplined and without knowledge.
She sits at the door of her house on a seat at the highest point of the city
calling out to those who pass by who go straight on their way.
Let all who are simple come in here! she says to those who lack judgment.
Stolen water is sweet food eaten in secret is delicious!
But little do they know that the dead are there that her guests are in the depths of the grave.

The prudent see danger and take refuge but the simple keep going and suffer for it.

As water reflects a face so a mans heart reflects the man.
Death and Destruction are never satisfied and neither are the eyes of man.
The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold but man is tested by the praise he receives.
Though you grind a fool in a mortar grinding him like grain with a pestle you will not remove his folly from him.
Be sure you know the condition of your flocks give careful attention to your herds
for riches do not endure forever and a crown is not secure for all generations.
When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in
the lambs will provide you with clothing and the goats with the price of a field.
You will have plenty of goats milk to feed you and your family and to nourish your servant girls.

The sayings of Agur son of Jakehan oracle This man declared to Ithiel to Ithiel and to Ucal
I am the most ignorant of men I do not have a mans understanding.
I have not learned wisdom nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.
Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered up the wind in the hollow of his hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name and the name of his son? Tell me if you know!
Every word of God is flawless he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
Do not add to his words or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.
Two things I ask of you O Lord do not refuse me before I die
Keep falsehood and lies far from me give me neither poverty nor riches but give me only my daily bread.
Otherwise I may have too much and disown you and say Who is the Lord? Or I may become poor and steal and so dishonor the name of my God.
Do not slander a servant to his master or he will curse you and you will pay for it.
There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers
those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth
those whose eyes are ever so haughty whose glances are so disdainful
those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth the needy from among mankind.
The leech has two daughters. Give! Give! they cry. There are three things that are never satisfied four that never say Enough!
the grave the barren womb land which is never satisfied with water and fire which never says Enough!
The eye that mocks a father that scorns obedience to a mother will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley will be eaten by the vultures.
There are three things that are too amazing for me four that I do not understand
the way of an eagle in the sky the way of a snake on a rock the way of a ship on the high seas and the way of a man with a maiden.
This is the way of an adulteress She eats and wipes her mouth and says Ive done nothing wrong.
Under three things the earth trembles under four it cannot bear up
a servant who becomes king a fool who is full of food
an unloved woman who is married and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.
Four things on earth are small yet they are extremely wise
Ants are creatures of little strength yet they store up their food in the summer
coneys are creatures of little power yet they make their home in the crags
locusts have no king yet they advance together in ranks
a lizard can be caught with the hand yet it is found in kings palaces.
There are three things that are stately in their stride four that move with stately bearing
a lion mighty among beasts who retreats before nothing
The sayings of King Lemuelan oracle his mother taught him
O my son O son of my womb O son of my vows
do not spend your strength on women your vigor on those who ruin kings.
It is not for kings O Lemuel not for kings to drink wine not for rulers to crave beer
lest they drink and forget what the law decrees and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.
Give beer to those who are perishing wine to those who are in anguish
let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.
Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves for the rights of all who are destitute.
Speak up and judge fairly defend the rights of the poor and needy.
A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.
Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.
She brings him good not harm all the days of her life.
She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.
She is like the merchant ships bringing her food from afar.
She gets up while it is still dark she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls.
She considers a field and buys it out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.
She sets about her work vigorously her arms are strong for her tasks.
The words of the Teacher son of David king in Jerusalem
Meaningless! Meaningless! says the Teacher. Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.
What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?
Generations come and generations go but the earth remains forever.
The sun rises and the sun sets and hurries back to where it rises.
The wind blows to the south and turns to the north round and round it goes ever returning on its course.
All streams flow into the sea yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from there they return again.
All things are wearisome more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing nor the ear its fill of hearing.
What has been will be again what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun.
Is there anything of which one can say Look! This is something new? It was here already long ago it was here before our time.
There is no remembrance of men of old and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.
I the Teacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!
I have seen all the things that are done under the sun all of them are meaningless a chasing after the wind.
What is twisted cannot be straightened what is lacking cannot be counted.
I thought to myself Look I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.
Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom and also of madness and folly but I learned that this too is a chasing after the wind.
For with much wisdom comes much sorrow the more knowledge the more grief.
I thought in my heart Come now I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good. But that also proved to be meaningless.
Laughter I said is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?
I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing follymy mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
I undertook great projects I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.
I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.
I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
I amassed silver and gold for myself and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers and a harem as wellthe delights of the heart of man.
I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.
I denied myself nothing my eyes desired I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work and this was the reward for all my labor.
Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve everything was meaningless a chasing after the wind nothing was gained under the sun.
Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom and also madness and folly. What more can the kings successor do than what has already been done?
I saw that wisdom is better than folly just as light is better than darkness.
The wise man has eyes in his head while the fool walks in the darkness but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.
Then I thought in my heart The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise? I said in my heart This too is meaningless.
For the wise man like the fool will not be long remembered in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool the wise man too must die!
So I hated life because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless a chasing after the wind.
I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.
And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.
For a man may do his work with wisdom knowledge and skill and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.
There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven
a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to uproot
a time to kill and a time to heal a time to tear down and a time to build
a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance
a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them a time to embrace and a time to refrain
a time to search and a time to give up a time to keep and a time to throw away
a time to tear and a time to mend a time to be silent and a time to speak
a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace.
What does the worker gain from his toil?
I have seen the burden God has laid on men.
He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.
That everyone may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his toilthis is the gift of God.
I know that everything God does will endure forever nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.
Whatever is has already been and what will be has been before and God will call the past to account.
Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun I saw the tears of the oppressed and they have no comforter power was on the side of their oppressors and they have no comforter.
And I declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are still alive.
But better than both is he who has not yet been who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from mans envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless a chasing after the wind.
The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.
Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.
Again I saw something meaningless under the sun
There was a man all alone he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. For whom am I toiling he asked and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment? This too is meaningless a miserable business!
Two are better than one because they have a good return for their work
If one falls down his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!
Also if two lie down together they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?
Though one may be overpowered two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.
The youth may have come from prison to the kingship or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.
I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth the kings successor.
There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless a chasing after the wind.
Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools who do not know that they do wrong.
Do not be quick with your mouth do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth so let your words be few.
As a dream comes when there are many cares so the speech of a fool when there are many words.
When you make a vow to God do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools fulfill your vow.
It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.
Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger My vow was a mistake. Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?
Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore stand in awe of God.
If you see the poor oppressed in a district and justice and rights denied do not be surprised at such things for one official is eyed by a higher one and over them both are others higher still.
The increase from the land is taken by all the king himself profits from the fields.
Whoever loves money never has money enough whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income. This too is meaningless.
As goods increase so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owner except to feast his eyes on them?
I have seen another evil under the sun and it weighs heavily on men
God gives a man wealth possessions and honor so that he lacks nothing his heart desires but God does not enable him to enjoy them and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless a grievous evil.
A man may have a hundred children and live many years yet no matter how long he lives if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
It comes without meaning it departs in darkness and in darkness its name is shrouded.
Though it never saw the sun or knew anything it has more rest than does that man
even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?
All mans efforts are for his mouth yet his appetite is never satisfied.
What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others?
Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless a chasing after the wind.
Whatever exists has already been named and what man is has been known no man can contend with one who is stronger than he.
The more the words the less the meaning and how does that profit anyone?
For who knows what is good for a man in life during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone?
A good name is better than fine perfume and the day of death better than the day of birth.
It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting for death is the destiny of every man the living should take this to heart.
Sorrow is better than laughter because a sad face is good for the heart.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
It is better to heed a wise mans rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.
Like the crackling of thorns under the pot so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.
Extortion turns a wise man into a fool and a bribe corrupts the heart.
The end of a matter is better than its beginning and patience is better than pride.
Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit for anger resides in the lap of fools.
Do not say Why were the old days better than these? For it is not wise to ask such questions.
Wisdom like an inheritance is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun.
Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter but the advantage of knowledge is this that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.
Consider what God has done Who can straighten what he has made crooked?
When times are good be happy but when times are bad consider God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore a man cannot discover anything about his future.
In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these a righteous man perishing in his righteousness and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.
Do not be overrighteous neither be overwise why destroy yourself?
Who is like the wise man? Who knows the explanation of things? Wisdom brightens a mans face and changes its hard appearance.
Obey the kings command I say because you took an oath before God.
Do not be in a hurry to leave the kings presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause for he will do whatever he pleases.
Since a kings word is supreme who can say to him What are you doing?
Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.
For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter though a mans misery weighs heavily upon him.
Since no man knows the future who can tell him what is to come?
No man has power over the wind to contain it so no one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in time of war so wickedness will not release those who practice it.
All this I saw as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt.
Then too I saw the wicked buriedthose who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.
When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong.
Although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes and still lives a long time I know that it will go better with Godfearing men who are reverent before God.
Yet because the wicked do not fear God it will not go well with them and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth righteous men who get what the wicked deserve and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too I say is meaningless.
So I commend the enjoyment of life because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun.
When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe mans labor on earthhis eyes not seeing sleep day or night
then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search it out man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he knows he cannot really comprehend it.
So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in Gods hands but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.
All share a common destinythe righteous and the wicked the good and the bad the clean and the unclean those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man so with the sinner as it is with those who take oaths so with those who are afraid to take them.
This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men moreover are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live and afterward they join the dead.
Anyone who is among the living has hope even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!
For the living know that they will die but the dead know nothing they have no further reward and even the memory of them is forgotten.
Their love their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.
Go eat your food with gladness and drink your wine with a joyful heart for it is now that God favors what you do.
Always be clothed in white and always anoint your head with oil.
Enjoy life with your wife whom you love all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.
Whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might for in the grave where you are going there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
I have seen something else under the sun The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned but time and chance happen to them all.
Moreover no man knows when his hour will come As fish are caught in a cruel net or birds are taken in a snare so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.
I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me
There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.
Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.
So I said Wisdom is better than strength. But the poor mans wisdom is despised and his words are no longer heeded.
The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroys much good.
As dead flies give perfume a bad smell so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
The heart of the wise inclines to the right but the heart of the fool to the left.
Even as he walks along the road the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is.
If a rulers anger rises against you do not leave your post calmness can lay great errors to rest.
There is an evil I have seen under the sun the sort of error that arises from a ruler
Fools are put in many high positions while the rich occupy the low ones.
I have seen slaves on horseback while princes go on foot like slaves.
Whoever digs a pit may fall into it whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.
Cast your bread upon the waters for after many days you will find it again.
Give portions to seven yes to eight for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.
If clouds are full of water they pour rain upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north in the place where it falls there will it lie.
Whoever watches the wind will not plant whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.
As you do not know the path of the wind or how the body is formed in a mothers womb so you cannot understand the work of God the Maker of all things.
Sow your seed in the morning and at evening let not your hands be idle for you do not know which will succeed whether this or that or whether both will do equally well.
Light is sweet and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.
However many years a man may live let him enjoy them all. But let him remember the days of darkness for they will be many. Everything to come is meaningless.
Be happy young man while you are young and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.
So then banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body for youth and vigor are meaningless.
Remember your Creator in the days of your youth before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say I find no pleasure in them
before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark and the clouds return after the rain
when the keepers of the house tremble and the strong men stoop when the grinders cease because they are few and those looking through the windows grow dim
when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades when men rise up at the sound of birds but all their songs grow faint
when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets.
Remember himbefore the silver cord is severed or the golden bowl is broken before the pitcher is shattered at the spring or the wheel broken at the well
and the dust returns to the ground it came from and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
Meaningless! Meaningless! says the Teacher. Everything is meaningless!
Not only was the Teacher wise but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.
The Teacher searched to find just the right words and what he wrote was upright and true.
The words of the wise are like goads their collected sayings like firmly embedded nailsgiven by one Shepherd.
Be warned my son of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end and much study wearies the body.
Now all has been heard here is the conclusion of the matter Fear God and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man.
For God will bring every deed into judgment including every hidden thing whether it is good or evil.
Solomons Song of Songs.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for your love is more delightful than wine.
Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love you!
Take me away with youlet us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!
Dark am I yet lovely O daughters of Jerusalem dark like the tents of Kedar like the tent curtains of Solomon.
Do not stare at me because I am dark because I am darkened by the sun. My mothers sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards my own vineyard I have neglected.
Tell me you whom I love where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?
If you do not know most beautiful of women follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.
I liken you my darling to a mare harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh.
Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings your neck with strings of jewels.
We will make you earrings of gold studded with silver.
While the king was at his table my perfume spread its fragrance.
My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.
My lover is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.
How beautiful you are my darling! Oh how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.
How handsome you are my lover! Oh how charming! And our bed is verdant.
The beams of our house are cedars our rafters are firs.
I am a rose of Sharon a lily of the valleys.
Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the maidens.
Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
He has taken me to the banquet hall and his banner over me is love.
Strengthen me with raisins refresh me with apples for I am faint with love.
His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.
Daughters of Jerusalem I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes leaping across the mountains bounding over the hills.
My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall gazing through the windows peering through the lattice.
My lover spoke and said to me Arise my darling my beautiful one and come with me.
All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves I looked for him but did not find him.
I will get up now and go about the city through its streets and squares I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him.
The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. Have you seen the one my heart loves?
Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go till I had brought him to my mothers house to the room of the one who conceived me.
Daughters of Jerusalem I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Who is this coming up from the desert like a column of smoke perfumed with myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the merchant?
Look! It is Solomons carriage escorted by sixty warriors the noblest of Israel
all of them wearing the sword all experienced in battle each with his sword at his side prepared for the terrors of the night.
King Solomon made for himself the carriage he made it of wood from Lebanon.
Its posts he made of silver its base of gold. Its seat was upholstered with purple its interior lovingly inlaid by the daughters of Jerusalem.
Come out you daughters of Zion and look at King Solomon wearing the crown the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding the day his heart rejoiced.
How beautiful you are my darling! Oh how beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Mount Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn coming up from the washing. Each has its twin not one of them is alone.
Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
Your neck is like the tower of David built with elegance on it hang a thousand shields all of them shields of warriors.
Your two breasts are like two fawns like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies.
Until the day breaks and the shadows flee I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of incense.
All beautiful you are my darling there is no flaw in you.
Come with me from Lebanon my bride come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the crest of Amana from the top of Senir the summit of Hermon from the lions dens and the mountain haunts of the leopards.
You have stolen my heart my sister my bride you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes with one jewel of your necklace.
How delightful is your love my sister my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine and the fragrance of your perfume than any spice!
Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb my bride milk and honey are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like that of Lebanon.
You are a garden locked up my sister my bride you are a spring enclosed a sealed fountain.
Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits with henna and nard
nard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with every kind of incense tree with myrrh and aloes and all the finest spices.
You are a garden fountain a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon.
Awake north wind and come south wind! Blow on my garden that its fragrance may spread abroad. Let my lover come into his garden and taste its choice fruits.
I have come into my garden my sister my bride I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat O friends and drink drink your fill O lovers.
I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My lover is knocking Open to me my sister my darling my dove my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew my hair with the dampness of the night.
I have taken off my robe must I put it on again? I have washed my feet must I soil them again?
My lover thrust his hand through the latchopening my heart began to pound for him.
I arose to open for my lover and my hands dripped with myrrh my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the lock.
I opened for my lover but my lover had left he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.
The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me they bruised me they took away my cloak those watchmen of the walls!
O daughters of Jerusalem I charge you if you find my lover what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.
How is your beloved better than others most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others that you charge us so?
My lover is radiant and ruddy outstanding among ten thousand.
His head is purest gold his hair is wavy and black as a raven.
His eyes are like doves by the water streams washed in milk mounted like jewels.
Where has your lover gone most beautiful of women? Which way did your lover turn that we may look for him with you?
My lover has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices to browse in the gardens and to gather lilies.
I am my lovers and my lover is mine he browses among the lilies.
You are beautiful my darling as Tirzah lovely as Jerusalem majestic as troops with banners.
Turn your eyes from me they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing. Each has its twin not one of them is alone.
Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
Sixty queens there may be and eighty concubines and virgins beyond number
but my dove my perfect one is unique the only daughter of her mother the favorite of the one who bore her. The maidens saw her and called her blessed the queens and concubines praised her.
Who is this that appears like the dawn fair as the moon bright as the sun majestic as the stars in procession?
I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.
Before I realized it my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.
Come back come back O Shulammite come back come back that we may gaze on you! Why would you gaze on the Shulammite as on the dance of Mahanaim?
How beautiful your sandaled feet O princes daughter! Your graceful legs are like jewels the work of a craftsmans hands.
Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by lilies.
Your breasts are like two fawns twins of a gazelle.
Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry the king is held captive by its tresses.
How beautiful you are and how pleasing O love with your delights!
Your stature is like that of the palm and your breasts like clusters of fruit.
I said I will climb the palm tree I will take hold of its fruit. May your breasts be like the clusters of the vine the fragrance of your breath like apples
and your mouth like the best wine. May the wine go straight to my lover flowing gently over lips and teeth.
I belong to my lover and his desire is for me.
Come my lover let us go to the countryside let us spend the night in the villages.
Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded if their blossoms have opened and if the pomegranates are in bloom there I will give you my love.
The mandrakes send out their fragrance and at our door is every delicacy both new and old that I have stored up for you my lover.
If only you were to me like a brother who was nursed at my mothers breasts! Then if I found you outside I would kiss you and no one would despise me.
I would lead you and bring you to my mothers house she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink the nectar of my pomegranates.
His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.
Daughters of Jerusalem I charge you Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you there your mother conceived you there she who was in labor gave you birth.
Place me like a seal over your heart like a seal on your arm for love is as strong as death its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire like a mighty flame.
Many waters cannot quench love rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love it would be utterly scorned.
We have a young sister and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for?
If she is a wall we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
I am a wall and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.
Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver.
But my own vineyard is mine to give the thousand shekels are for you O Solomon and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.
You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance let me hear your voice!
Come away my lover and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spiceladen mountains.
The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah.
Hear O heavens! Listen O earth! For the Lord has spoken I reared children and brought them up but they have rebelled against me.
The ox knows his master the donkey his owners manger but Israel does not know my people do not understand.
Ah sinful nation a people loaded with guilt a brood of evildoers children given to corruption! They have forsaken the Lord they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.
Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured your whole heart afflicted.
From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness only wounds and welts and open sores not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.
Your country is desolate your cities burned with fire your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.
The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard like a hut in a field of melons like a city under siege.
Unless the Lord Almighty had left us some survivors we would have become like Sodom we would have been like Gomorrah.
Hear the word of the Lord you rulers of Sodom listen to the law of our God you people of Gomorrah!
The multitude of your sacrifices what are they to me? says the Lord. I have more than enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened animals I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
When you come to appear before me who has asked this of you this trampling of my courts?
Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons Sabbaths and convocations I cannot bear your evil assemblies.
Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me I am weary of bearing them.
When you spread out your hands in prayer I will hide my eyes from you even if you offer many prayers I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood
wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong
learn to do right! Seek justice encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless plead the case of the widow.
Come now let us reason together says the Lord. Though your sins are like scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they are red as crimson they shall be like wool.
If you are willing and obedient you will eat the best from the land
but if you resist and rebel you will be devoured by the sword. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice righteousness used to dwell in her but now murderers!
This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem
In the last days the mountain of the Lords temple will be established as chief among the mountains it will be raised above the hills and all nations will stream to it.
Many peoples will come and say Come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths. The law will go out from Zion the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war anymore.
Come O house of Jacob let us walk in the light of the Lord.
You have abandoned your people the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.
Their land is full of silver and gold there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses there is no end to their chariots.
Their land is full of idols they bow down to the work of their hands to what their fingers have made.
So man will be brought low and mankind humbled do not forgive them.
Go into the rocks hide in the ground from dread of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty!
The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
The Lord Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty for all that is exalted 
for all the cedars of Lebanon tall and lofty and all the oaks of Bashan
for all the towering mountains and all the high hills
for every lofty tower and every fortified wall
for every trading ship and every stately vessel.
The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled the Lord alone will be exalted in that day
and the idols will totally disappear.
Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.
In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold which they made to worship.
They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth.
Stop trusting in man who has but a breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?
See now the Lord the Lord Almighty is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support all supplies of food and all supplies of water
the hero and warrior the judge and prophet the soothsayer and elder
the captain of fifty and man of rank the counselor skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.
I will make boys their officials mere children will govern them.
People will oppress each other man against man neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old the base against the honorable.
In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!
In that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.
Those who are left in Zion who remain in Jerusalem will be called holy all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night over all the glory will be a canopy.
It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.
I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.
He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes but it yielded only bad fruit.
Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah judge between me and my vineyard.
What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes why did it yield only bad?
Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard I will take away its hedge and it will be destroyed I will break down its wall and it will be trampled.
I will make it a wasteland neither pruned nor cultivated and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.
The vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the house of Israel and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice but saw bloodshed for righteousness but heard cries of distress.
Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land.
The Lord Almighty has declared in my hearing Surely the great houses will become desolate the fine mansions left without occupants.
A tenacre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.
Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.
They have harps and lyres at their banquets tambourines and flutes and wine but they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord no respect for the work of his hands.
In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord seated on a throne high and exalted and the train of his robe filled the temple.
Above him were seraphs each with six wings With two wings they covered their faces with two they covered their feet and with two they were flying.
And they were calling to one another Holy holy holy is the Lord Almighty the whole earth is full of his glory.
At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.
Woe to me! I cried. I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the King the Lord Almighty.
Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
With it he touched my mouth and said See this has touched your lips your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.
Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying Whom shall I send? And who will go for us? And I said Here am I. Send me!
He said Go and tell this people  Be ever hearing but never understanding be ever seeing but never perceiving.
Make the heart of this people calloused make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and be healed.
Then I said For how long O Lord? And he answered Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged
until the Lord has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.
And though a tenth remains in the land it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down so the holy seed will be the stump in the land.
When Ahaz son of Jotham the son of Uzziah was king of Judah King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem but they could not overpower it.
Now the house of David was told Aram has allied itself with Ephraim so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.
Then the Lord said to Isaiah Go out you and your son ShearJashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool on the road to the Washermans Field.
Say to him Be careful keep calm and dont be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewoodbecause of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
Aram Ephraim and Remaliahs son have plotted your ruin saying
Let us invade Judah let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves and make the son of Tabeel king over it.
Yet this is what the Sovereign Lord says  It will not take place it will not happen
for the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixtyfive years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
The head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is only Remaliahs son. If you do not stand firm in your faith you will not stand at all. 
Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz
Ask the Lord your God for a sign whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.
But Ahaz said I will not ask I will not put the Lord to the test.
Then Isaiah said Hear now you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?
Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel.
He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.
But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
The Lord will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judahhe will bring the king of Assyria.
In that day the Lord will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.
In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the River the king of Assyriato shave your head and the hair of your legs and to take off your beards also.
In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats.
The Lord said to me Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen MaherShalalHashBaz.
And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me.
Then I went to the prophetess and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the Lord said to me Name him MaherShalalHashBaz.
Before the boy knows how to say My father or My mother the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.
The Lord spoke to me again
Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah
therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels run over all its banks
and sweep on into Judah swirling over it passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land O Immanuel!
Raise the war cry you nations and be shattered! Listen all you distant lands. Prepare for battle and be shattered! Prepare for battle and be shattered!
Devise your strategy but it will be thwarted propose your plan but it will not stand for God is with us.
The Lord spoke to me with his strong hand upon me warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said
Do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy do not fear what they fear and do not dread it.
The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy he is the one you are to fear he is the one you are to dread
and he will be a sanctuary but for both houses of Israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
Many of them will stumble they will fall and be broken they will be snared and captured.
Bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples.
I will wait for the Lord who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.
Here am I and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the Lord Almighty who dwells on Mount Zion.
When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists who whisper and mutter should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word they have no light of dawn.
Nevertheless there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali but in the future he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles by the way of the sea along the Jordan
The people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.
You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest as men rejoice when dividing the plunder.
For as in the day of Midians defeat you have shattered the yoke that burdens them the bar across their shoulders the rod of their oppressor.
Every warriors boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning will be fuel for the fire.
For to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor Mighty God Everlasting Father Prince of Peace.
Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on Davids throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
The Lord has sent a message against Jacob it will fall on Israel.
All the people will know it Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria who say with pride and arrogance of heart
The bricks have fallen down but we will rebuild with dressed stone the fig trees have been felled but we will replace them with cedars.
But the Lord has strengthened Rezins foes against them and has spurred their enemies on.
Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth. Yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised.
But the people have not returned to him who struck them nor have they sought the Lord Almighty.
So the Lord will cut off from Israel both head and tail both palm branch and reed in a single day
the elders and prominent men are the head the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
Those who guide this people mislead them and those who are guided are led astray.
Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men nor will he pity the fatherless and widows for everyone is ungodly and wicked every mouth speaks vileness. Yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised.
Surely wickedness burns like a fire it consumes briers and thorns it sets the forest thickets ablaze so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.
By the wrath of the Lord Almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire no one will spare his brother.
On the right they will devour but still be hungry on the left they will eat but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring
Manasseh will feed on Ephraim and Ephraim on Manasseh together they will turn against Judah. Yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised.
Woe to those who make unjust laws to those who issue oppressive decrees
to deprive the poor of their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people making widows their prey and robbing the fatherless.
What will you do on the day of reckoning when disaster comes from afar? To whom will you run for help? Where will you leave your riches?
Nothing will remain but to cringe among the captives or fall among the slain. Yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised.
Woe to the Assyrian the rod of my anger in whose hand is the club of my wrath!
I send him against a godless nation I dispatch him against a people who anger me to seize loot and snatch plunder and to trample them down like mud in the streets.
But this is not what he intends this is not what he has in mind his purpose is to destroy to put an end to many nations.
Are not my commanders all kings? he says.
Has not Calno fared like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad and Samaria like Damascus?
As my hand seized the kingdoms of the idols kingdoms whose images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria
shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her images as I dealt with Samaria and her idols? 
When the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem he will say I will punish the king of Assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes.
For he says  By the strength of my hand I have done this and by my wisdom because I have understanding. I removed the boundaries of nations I plundered their treasures like a mighty one I subdued their kings.
As one reaches into a nest so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations as men gather abandoned eggs so I gathered all the countries not one flapped a wing or opened its mouth to chirp. 
Does the ax raise itself above him who swings it or the saw boast against him who uses it? As if a rod were to wield him who lifts it up or a club brandish him who is not wood!
A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.
The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding the Spirit of counsel and of power the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord
and he will delight in the fear of the Lord. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes or decide by what he hears with his ears
but with righteousness he will judge the needy with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.
Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist.
In that day you will say I will praise you O Lord. Although you were angry with me your anger has turned away and you have comforted me.
Surely God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid. The Lord the Lord is my strength and my song he has become my salvation.
With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
In that day you will say Give thanks to the Lord call on his name make known among the nations what he has done and proclaim that his name is exalted.
Sing to the Lord for he has done glorious things let this be known to all the world.
Shout aloud and sing for joy people of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.
An oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw
Raise a banner on a bare hilltop shout to them beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles.
I have commanded my holy ones I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath those who rejoice in my triumph.
Listen a noise on the mountains like that of a great multitude! Listen an uproar among the kingdoms like nations massing together! The Lord Almighty is mustering an army for war.
They come from faraway lands from the ends of the heavens the Lord and the weapons of his wrath to destroy the whole country.
Wail for the day of the Lord is near it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
Because of this all hands will go limp every mans heart will melt.
Terror will seize them pain and anguish will grip them they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other their faces aflame.
See the day of the Lord is coming a cruel day with wrath and fierce anger to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.
The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.
I will punish the world for its evil the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless.
I will make man scarcer than pure gold more rare than the gold of Ophir.
Therefore I will make the heavens tremble and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the Lord Almighty in the day of his burning anger.
Like a hunted gazelle like sheep without a shepherd each will return to his own people each will flee to his native land.
Whoever is captured will be thrust through all who are caught will fall by the sword.
Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses will be looted and their wives ravished.
See I will stir up against them the Medes who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold.
Their bows will strike down the young men they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children.
Babylon the jewel of kingdoms the glory of the Babylonians pride will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations no Arab will pitch his tent there no shepherd will rest his flocks there.
But desert creatures will lie there jackals will fill her houses there the owls will dwell and there the wild goats will leap about.
Hyenas will howl in her strongholds jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand and her days will not be prolonged.
The Lord will have compassion on Jacob once again he will choose Israel and will settle them in their own land. Aliens will join them and unite with the house of Jacob.
Nations will take them and bring them to their own place. And the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the Lords land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors.
On the day the Lord gives you relief from suffering and turmoil and cruel bondage
you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!
The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked the scepter of the rulers
which in anger struck down peoples with unceasing blows and in fury subdued nations with relentless aggression.
All the lands are at rest and at peace they break into singing.
Even the pine trees and the cedars of Lebanon exult over you and say Now that you have been laid low no woodsman comes to cut us down.
An oracle concerning Moab Ar in Moab is ruined destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined destroyed in a night!
Dibon goes up to its temple to its high places to weep Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.
In the streets they wear sackcloth on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail prostrate with weeping.
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out and their hearts are faint.
My heart cries out over Moab her fugitives flee as far as Zoar as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way to Luhith weeping as they go on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.
The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left.
So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.
Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.
Dimons waters are full of blood but I will bring still more upon Dimon a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.
Send lambs as tribute to the ruler of the land from Sela across the desert to the mount of the Daughter of Zion.
Like fluttering birds pushed from the nest so are the women of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.
Give us counsel render a decision. Make your shadow like night at high noon. Hide the fugitives do not betray the refugees.
Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you be their shelter from the destroyer. The oppressor will come to an end and destruction will cease the aggressor will vanish from the land.
In love a throne will be established in faithfulness a man will sit on it one from the house of David one who in judging seeks justice and speeds the cause of righteousness.
We have heard of Moabs pride her overweening pride and conceit her pride and her insolence but her boasts are empty.
Therefore the Moabites wail they wail together for Moab. Lament and grieve for the men of Kir Hareseth.
The fields of Heshbon wither the vines of Sibmah also. The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea.
So I weep as Jazer weeps for the vines of Sibmah. O Heshbon O Elealeh I drench you with tears! The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled.
Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards no one sings or shouts in the vineyards no one treads out wine at the presses for I have put an end to the shouting.
My heart laments for Moab like a harp my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.
When Moab appears at her high place she only wears herself out when she goes to her shrine to pray it is to no avail.
This is the word the Lord has already spoken concerning Moab.
But now the Lord says Within three years as a servant bound by contract would count them Moabs splendor and all her many people will be despised and her survivors will be very few and feeble.
An oracle concerning Damascus See Damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins.
The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left to flocks which will lie down with no one to make them afraid.
The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim and royal power from Damascus the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the Israelites declares the Lord Almighty.
In that day the glory of Jacob will fade the fat of his body will waste away.
It will be as when a reaper gathers the standing grain and harvests the grain with his arm as when a man gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
Yet some gleanings will remain as when an olive tree is beaten leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches four or five on the fruitful boughs declares the Lord the God of Israel.
Woe to the land of whirring wings along the rivers of Cush
which sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats over the water. Go swift messengers to a people tall and smoothskinned to a people feared far and wide an aggressive nation of strange speech whose land is divided by rivers.
All you people of the world you who live on the earth when a banner is raised on the mountains you will see it and when a trumpet sounds you will hear it.
This is what the Lord says to me I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place like shimmering heat in the sunshine like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
For before the harvest when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives and cut down and take away the spreading branches.
They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals the birds will feed on them all summer the wild animals all winter.
At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord Almighty from a people tall and smoothskinned from a people feared far and wide an aggressive nation of strange speech whose land is divided by rivers the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion the place of the Name of the Lord Almighty.
An oracle concerning Egypt See the Lord rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him and the hearts of the Egyptians melt within them.
I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian brother will fight against brother neighbor against neighbor city against city kingdom against kingdom.
The Egyptians will lose heart and I will bring their plans to nothing they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead the mediums and the spiritists.
I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master and a fierce king will rule over them declares the Lord the Lord Almighty.
The waters of the river will dry up and the riverbed will be parched and dry.
In the year that the supreme commander sent by Sargon king of Assyria came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it
at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet. And he did so going around stripped and barefoot.
Then the Lord said Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush
so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles young and old with buttocks baredto Egypts shame.
Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be afraid and put to shame.
In that day the people who live on this coast will say See what has happened to those we relied on those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape? 
An oracle concerning the Desert by the Sea Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland an invader comes from the desert from a land of terror.
A dire vision has been shown to me The traitor betrays the looter takes loot. Elam attack! Media lay siege! I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused.
At this my body is racked with pain pangs seize me like those of a woman in labor I am staggered by what I hear I am bewildered by what I see.
My heart falters fear makes me tremble the twilight I longed for has become a horror to me.
They set the tables they spread the rugs they eat they drink! Get up you officers oil the shields!
This is what the Lord says to me Go post a lookout and have him report what he sees.
When he sees chariots with teams of horses riders on donkeys or riders on camels let him be alert fully alert.
And the lookout shouted Day after day my lord I stand on the watchtower every night I stay at my post.
Look here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer Babylon has fallen has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground! 
O my people crushed on the threshing floor I tell you what I have heard from the Lord Almighty from the God of Israel.
An oracle concerning Dumah Someone calls to me from Seir Watchman what is left of the night? Watchman what is left of the night?
The watchman replies Morning is coming but also the night. If you would ask then ask and come back yet again.
An oracle concerning Arabia You caravans of Dedanites who camp in the thickets of Arabia
bring water for the thirsty you who live in Tema bring food for the fugitives.
They flee from the sword from the drawn sword from the bent bow and from the heat of battle.
This is what the Lord says to me Within one year as a servant bound by contract would count it all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end.
The survivors of the bowmen the warriors of Kedar will be few. The Lord the God of Israel has spoken.
An oracle concerning the Valley of Vision What troubles you now that you have all gone up on the roofs
O town full of commotion O city of tumult and revelry? Your slain were not killed by the sword nor did they die in battle.
All your leaders have fled together they have been captured without using the bow. All you who were caught were taken prisoner together having fled while the enemy was still far away.
Therefore I said Turn away from me let me weep bitterly. Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people.
The Lord the Lord Almighty has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains.
Elam takes up the quiver with her charioteers and horses Kir uncovers the shield.
Your choicest valleys are full of chariots and horsemen are posted at the city gates
the defenses of Judah are stripped away. And you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest
you saw that the City of David had many breaches in its defenses you stored up water in the Lower Pool.
You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.
You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool but you did not look to the One who made it or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.
The Lord the Lord Almighty called you on that day to weep and to wail to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.
But see there is joy and revelry slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep eating of meat and drinking of wine! Let us eat and drink you say for tomorrow we die!
The Lord Almighty has revealed this in my hearing Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for says the Lord the Lord Almighty.
This is what the Lord the Lord Almighty says Go say to this steward to Shebna who is in charge of the palace
What are you doing here and who gave you permission to cut out a grave for yourself here hewing your grave on the height and chiseling your resting place in the rock?
Beware the Lord is about to take firm hold of you and hurl you away O you mighty man.
An oracle concerning Tyre Wail O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus word has come to them.
Be silent you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon whom the seafarers have enriched.
On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre and she became the marketplace of the nations.
Be ashamed O Sidon and you O fortress of the sea for the sea has spoken I have neither been in labor nor given birth I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters.
When word comes to Egypt they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.
Cross over to Tarshish wail you people of the island.
Is this your city of revelry the old old city whose feet have taken her to settle in faroff lands?
Who planned this against Tyre the bestower of crowns whose merchants are princes whose traders are renowned in the earth?
The Lord Almighty planned it to bring low the pride of all glory and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.
Till your land as along the Nile O Daughter of Tarshish for you no longer have a harbor.
The Lord has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia that her fortresses be destroyed.
He said No more of your reveling O Virgin Daughter of Sidon now crushed! Up cross over to Cyprus even there you will find no rest.
Look at the land of the Babylonians this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures they raised up their siege towers they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin.
Wail you ships of Tarshish your fortress is destroyed!
At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years the span of a kings life. But at the end of these seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute
Take up a harp walk through the city O prostitute forgotten play the harp well sing many a song so that you will be remembered.
At the end of seventy years the Lord will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the Lord they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the Lord for abundant food and fine clothes.
See the Lord is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants
it will be the same for priest as for people for master as for servant for mistress as for maid for seller as for buyer for borrower as for lender for debtor as for creditor.
The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered. The Lord has spoken this word.
The earth dries up and withers the world languishes and withers the exalted of the earth languish.
The earth is defiled by its people they have disobeyed the laws violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.
Therefore a curse consumes the earth its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earths inhabitants are burned up and very few are left.
The new wine dries up and the vine withers all the merrymakers groan.
The gaiety of the tambourines is stilled the noise of the revelers has stopped the joyful harp is silent.
No longer do they drink wine with a song the beer is bitter to its drinkers.
The ruined city lies desolate the entrance to every house is barred.
In the streets they cry out for wine all joy turns to gloom all gaiety is banished from the earth.
O Lord you are my God I will exalt you and praise your name for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things things planned long ago.
You have made the city a heap of rubble the fortified town a ruin the foreigners stronghold a city no more it will never be rebuilt.
Therefore strong peoples will honor you cities of ruthless nations will revere you.
You have been a refuge for the poor a refuge for the needy in his distress a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall
and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud so the song of the ruthless is stilled.
On this mountain the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples a banquet of aged wine the best of meats and the finest of wines.
On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples the sheet that covers all nations
he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth. The Lord has spoken.
In that day they will say Surely this is our God we trusted in him and he saved us. This is the Lord we trusted in him let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.
The hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain but Moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure.
They will spread out their hands in it as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness of their hands.
He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low he will bring them down to the ground to the very dust.
In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah We have a strong city God makes salvation its walls and ramparts.
Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter the nation that keeps faith.
You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast because he trusts in you.
Trust in the Lord forever for the Lord the Lord is the Rock eternal.
He humbles those who dwell on high he lays the lofty city low he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust.
Feet trample it down the feet of the oppressed the footsteps of the poor.
The path of the righteous is level O upright One you make the way of the righteous smooth.
Yes Lord walking in the way of your laws we wait for you your name and renown are the desire of our hearts.
My soul yearns for you in the night in the morning my spirit longs for you. When your judgments come upon the earth the people of the world learn righteousness.
Though grace is shown to the wicked they do not learn righteousness even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and regard not the majesty of the Lord.
O Lord your hand is lifted high but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.
Lord you establish peace for us all that we have accomplished you have done for us.
In that day the Lord will punish with his sword his fierce great and powerful sword Leviathan the gliding serpent Leviathan the coiling serpent he will slay the monster of the sea.
In that day Sing about a fruitful vineyard
I the Lord watch over it I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it.
I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle I would set them all on fire.
Or else let them come to me for refuge let them make peace with me yes let them make peace with me.
In days to come Jacob will take root Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit.
Has the Lord struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her?
By warfare and exile you contend with her with his fierce blast he drives her out as on a day the east wind blows.
By this then will Jacobs guilt be atoned for and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing.
The fortified city stands desolate an abandoned settlement forsaken like the desert there the calves graze there they lie down they strip its branches bare.
When its twigs are dry they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding so their Maker has no compassion on them and their Creator shows them no favor.
In that day the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt and you O Israelites will be gathered up one by one.
And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
Woe to that wreath the pride of Ephraims drunkards to the fading flower his glorious beauty set on the head of a fertile valley to that city the pride of those laid low by wine!
See the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind like a driving rain and a flooding downpour he will throw it forcefully to the ground.
That wreath the pride of Ephraims drunkards will be trampled underfoot.
That fading flower his glorious beauty set on the head of a fertile valley will be like a fig ripe before harvest as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand he swallows it.
In that day the Lord Almighty will be a glorious crown a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.
He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine they reel from beer they stagger when seeing visions they stumble when rendering decisions.
All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.
Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk to those just taken from the breast?
For it is Do and do do and do rule on rule rule on rule a little here a little there.
Very well then with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people
to whom he said This is the resting place let the weary rest and This is the place of repose but they would not listen.
So then the word of the Lord to them will become Do and do do and do rule on rule rule on rule a little here a little there so that they will go and fall backward be injured and snared and captured.
Therefore hear the word of the Lord you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
You boast We have entered into a covenant with death with the grave we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by it cannot touch us for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood our hiding place.
So this is what the Sovereign Lord says See I lay a stone in Zion a tested stone a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation the one who trusts will never be dismayed.
I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line hail will sweep away your refuge the lie and water will overflow your hiding place.
Your covenant with death will be annulled your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by you will be beaten down by it.
As often as it comes it will carry you away morning after morning by day and by night it will sweep through. The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.
The bed is too short to stretch out on the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.
The Lord will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon to do his work his strange work and perform his task his alien task.
Now stop your mocking or your chains will become heavier the Lord the Lord Almighty has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.
Listen and hear my voice pay attention and hear what I say.
Woe to you Ariel Ariel the city where David settled! Add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on.
Yet I will besiege Ariel she will mourn and lament she will be to me like an altar hearth.
I will encamp against you all around I will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you.
Brought low you will speak from the ground your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth out of the dust your speech will whisper.
But your many enemies will become like fine dust the ruthless hordes like blown chaff. Suddenly in an instant
the Lord Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire.
Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel that attack her and her fortress and besiege her will be as it is with a dream with a vision in the night
as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating but he awakens and his hunger remains as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking but he awakens faint with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion.
Be stunned and amazed blind yourselves and be sightless be drunk but not from wine stagger but not from beer.
The Lord has brought over you a deep sleep He has sealed your eyes  he has covered your heads .
For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read and say to him Read this please he will answer I cant it is sealed.
Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read and say Read this please he will answer I dont know how to read.
The Lord says These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men.
Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder the wisdom of the wise will perish the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.
Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the Lord who do their work in darkness and think Who sees us? Who will know?
You turn things upside down as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him who formed it He did not make me? Can the pot say of the potter He knows nothing?
In a very short time will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest?
In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
Once more the humble will rejoice in the Lord the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
The ruthless will vanish the mockers will disappear and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down
those who with a word make a man out to be guilty who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.
Therefore this is what the Lord who redeemed Abraham says to the house of Jacob No longer will Jacob be ashamed no longer will their faces grow pale.
When they see among them their children the work of my hands they will keep my name holy they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding those who complain will accept instruction.
Woe to the obstinate children declares the Lord to those who carry out plans that are not mine forming an alliance but not by my Spirit heaping sin upon sin
who go down to Egypt without consulting me who look for help to Pharaohs protection to Egypts shade for refuge.
But Pharaohs protection will be to your shame Egypts shade will bring you disgrace.
Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes
everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them who bring neither help nor advantage but only shame and disgrace.
An oracle concerning the animals of the Negev Through a land of hardship and distress of lions and lionesses of adders and darting snakes the envoys carry their riches on donkeys backs their treasures on the humps of camels to that unprofitable nation
to Egypt whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the DoNothing.
Go now write it on a tablet for them inscribe it on a scroll that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness.
Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help who rely on horses who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or seek help from the Lord.
Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster he does not take back his words. He will rise up against the house of the wicked against those who help evildoers.
But the Egyptians are men and not God their horses are flesh and not spirit. When the Lord stretches out his hand he who helps will stumble he who is helped will fall both will perish together.
This is what the Lord says to me As a lion growls a great lion over his prey and though a whole band of shepherds is called together against him he is not frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamor so the Lord Almighty will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights.
Like birds hovering overhead the Lord Almighty will shield Jerusalem he will shield it and deliver it he will pass over it and will rescue it.
Return to him you have so greatly revolted against O Israelites.
For in that day every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your sinful hands have made.
Assyria will fall by a sword that is not of man a sword not of mortals will devour them. They will flee before the sword and their young men will be put to forced labor.
Their stronghold will fall because of terror at sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic declares the Lord whose fire is in Zion whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
See a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice.
Each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed and the ears of those who hear will listen.
The mind of the rash will know and understand and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.
No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
For the fool speaks folly his mind is busy with evil He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the Lord the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.
The scoundrels methods are wicked he makes up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies even when the plea of the needy is just.
But the noble man makes noble plans and by noble deeds he stands.
You women who are so complacent rise up and listen to me you daughters who feel secure hear what I have to say!
In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble the grape harvest will fail and the harvest of fruit will not come.
Tremble you complacent women shudder you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your clothes put sackcloth around your waists.
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vines
and for the land of my people a land overgrown with thorns and briers yes mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry.
The fortress will be abandoned the noisy city deserted citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever the delight of donkeys a pasture for flocks
till the Spirit is poured upon us from on high and the desert becomes a fertile field and the fertile field seems like a forest.
Justice will dwell in the desert and righteousness live in the fertile field.
The fruit of righteousness will be peace the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.
My people will live in peaceful dwelling places in secure homes in undisturbed places of rest.
Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely
how blessed you will be sowing your seed by every stream and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.
Woe to you O destroyer you who have not been destroyed! Woe to you O traitor you who have not been betrayed! When you stop destroying you will be destroyed when you stop betraying you will be betrayed.
O Lord be gracious to us we long for you. Be our strength every morning our salvation in time of distress.
At the thunder of your voice the peoples flee when you rise up the nations scatter.
Your plunder O nations is harvested as by young locusts like a swarm of locusts men pounce on it.
The Lord is exalted for he dwells on high he will fill Zion with justice and righteousness.
He will be the sure foundation for your times a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge the fear of the Lord is the key to this treasure.
Look their brave men cry aloud in the streets the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
The highways are deserted no travelers are on the roads. The treaty is broken its witnesses are despised no one is respected.
The land mourns and wastes away Lebanon is ashamed and withers Sharon is like the Arabah and Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves.
Now will I arise says the Lord. Now will I be exalted now will I be lifted up.
You conceive chaff you give birth to straw your breath is a fire that consumes you.
The peoples will be burned as if to lime like cut thornbushes they will be set ablaze.
You who are far away hear what I have done you who are near acknowledge my power!
The sinners in Zion are terrified trembling grips the godless Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire? Who of us can dwell with everlasting burning?
He who walks righteously and speaks what is right who rejects gain from extortion and keeps his hand from accepting bribes who stops his ears against plots of murder and shuts his eyes against contemplating evil
this is the man who will dwell on the heights whose refuge will be the mountain fortress. His bread will be supplied and water will not fail him.
Come near you nations and listen pay attention you peoples! Let the earth hear and all that is in it the world and all that comes out of it!
The Lord is angry with all nations his wrath is upon all their armies. He will totally destroy them he will give them over to slaughter.
Their slain will be thrown out their dead bodies will send up a stench the mountains will be soaked with their blood.
All the stars of the heavens will be dissolved and the sky rolled up like a scroll all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine like shriveled figs from the fig tree.
My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens see it descends in judgment on Edom the people I have totally destroyed.
The sword of the Lord is bathed in blood it is covered with fat the blood of lambs and goats fat from the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in Edom.
And the wild oxen will fall with them the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood and the dust will be soaked with fat.
For the Lord has a day of vengeance a year of retribution to uphold Zions cause.
Edoms streams will be turned into pitch her dust into burning sulfur her land will become blazing pitch!
The desert and the parched land will be glad the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus
it will burst into bloom it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it the splendor of Carmel and Sharon they will see the glory of the Lord the splendor of our God.
Strengthen the feeble hands steady the knees that give way
say to those with fearful hearts Be strong do not fear your God will come he will come with vengeance with divine retribution he will come to save you.
Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
Then will the lame leap like a deer and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.
The burning sand will become a pool the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.
And a highway will be there it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not journey on it it will be for those who walk in that Way wicked fools will not go about on it.
No lion will be there nor will any ferocious beast get up on it they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there
and the ransomed of the Lord will return. They will enter Zion with singing everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiahs reign Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool on the road to the Washermans Field
Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.
The field commander said to them Tell Hezekiah  This is what the great king the king of Assyria says On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
You say you have strategy and military strengthbut you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending that you rebel against me?
Look now you are depending on Egypt that splintered reed of a staff which pierces a mans hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
And if you say to me We are depending on the Lord our Godisnt he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed saying to Judah and Jerusalem You must worship before this altar?
 Come now make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria I will give you two thousand horsesif you can put riders on them!
How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my masters officials even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
Furthermore have I come to attack and destroy this land without the Lord? The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it. 
Then Eliakim Shebna and Joah said to the field commander Please speak to your servants in Aramaic since we understand it. Dont speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.
But the commander replied Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things and not to the men sitting on the wallwho like you will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?
Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew Hear the words of the great king the king of Assyria!
This is what the king says Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!
Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says The Lord will surely deliver us this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern
until I come and take you to a land like your owna land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards.
Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says The Lord will deliver us. Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand?
But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply because the king had commanded Do not answer him.
Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what the field commander had said.
When King Hezekiah heard this he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the Lord.
He sent Eliakim the palace administrator Shebna the secretary and the leading priests all wearing sackcloth to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
They told him This is what Hezekiah says This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the field commander whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to ridicule the living God and that he will rebuke him for the words the Lord your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.
When King Hezekiahs officials came to Isaiah
Isaiah said to them Tell your master This is what the Lord says Do not be afraid of what you have heardthose words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
Listen! I am going to put a spirit in him so that when he hears a certain report he will return to his own country and there I will have him cut down with the sword. 
When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah the Cushite king of Egypt was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word
Say to Hezekiah king of Judah Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.
Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver themthe gods of Gozan Haran Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
Where is the king of Hamath the king of Arpad the king of the city of Sepharvaim or of Hena or Ivvah?
Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.
And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord
O Lord Almighty God of Israel enthroned between the cherubim you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
Give ear O Lord and hear open your eyes O Lord and see listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
It is true O Lord that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands.
They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them for they were not gods but only wood and stone fashioned by human hands.
Now O Lord our God deliver us from his hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone O Lord are God.
Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria
In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said This is what the Lord says Put your house in order because you are going to die you will not recover.
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord
Remember O Lord how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah
Go and tell Hezekiah This is what the Lord the God of your father David says I have heard your prayer and seen your tears I will add fifteen years to your life.
And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
 This is the Lords sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised
At that time MerodachBaladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift because he had heard of his illness and recovery.
Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehousesthe silver the gold the spices the fine oil his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked What did those men say and where did they come from? From a distant land Hezekiah replied. They came to me from Babylon.
The prophet asked What did they see in your palace? They saw everything in my palace Hezekiah said. There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah Hear the word of the Lord Almighty
The time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left says the Lord.
And some of your descendants your own flesh and blood who will be born to you will be taken away and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
The word of the Lord you have spoken is good Hezekiah replied. For he thought There will be peace and security in my lifetime.
Comfort comfort my people says your God.
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed that her sin has been paid for that she has received from the Lords hand double for all her sins.
A voice of one calling In the desert prepare the way for the Lord make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God.
Every valley shall be raised up every mountain and hill made low the rough ground shall become level the rugged places a plain.
And the glory of the Lord will be revealed and all mankind together will see it. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
A voice says Cry out. And I said What shall I cry? All men are like grass and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.
The grass withers and the flowers fall because the breath of the Lord blows on them. Surely the people are grass.
The grass withers and the flowers fall but the word of our God stands forever.
You who bring good tidings to Zion go up on a high mountain. You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem lift up your voice with a shout lift it up do not be afraid say to the towns of Judah Here is your God!
See the Sovereign Lord comes with power and his arm rules for him. See his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him.
He tends his flock like a shepherd He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart he gently leads those that have young.
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?
Who has understood the mind of the Lord or instructed him as his counselor?
Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding?
Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket they are regarded as dust on the scales he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
Before him all the nations are as nothing they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing.
To whom then will you compare God? What image will you compare him to?
As for an idol a craftsman casts it and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.
A man too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot. He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple.
Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
No sooner are they planted no sooner are they sown no sooner do they take root in the ground than he blows on them and they wither and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.
To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal? says the Holy One.
Lift your eyes and look to the heavens Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength not one of them is missing.
Why do you say O Jacob and complain O Israel My way is hidden from the Lord my cause is disregarded by my God?
Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary and his understanding no one can fathom.
Be silent before me you islands! Let the nations renew their strength! Let them come forward and speak let us meet together at the place of judgment.
Who has stirred up one from the east calling him in righteousness to his service? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword to windblown chaff with his bow.
He pursues them and moves on unscathed by a path his feet have not traveled before.
Who has done this and carried it through calling forth the generations from the beginning? I the Lordwith the first of them and with the lastI am he.
The islands have seen it and fear the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward
each helps the other and says to his brother Be strong!
The craftsman encourages the goldsmith and he who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil. He says of the welding It is good. He nails down the idol so it will not topple.
But you O Israel my servant Jacob whom I have chosen you descendants of Abraham my friend
I took you from the ends of the earth from its farthest corners I called you. I said You are my servant I have chosen you and have not rejected you.
So do not fear for I am with you do not be dismayed for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish.
Though you search for your enemies you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all.
For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you Do not fear I will help you.
Do not be afraid O worm Jacob O little Israel for I myself will help you declares the Lord your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel.
See I will make you into a threshing sledge new and sharp with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them and reduce the hills to chaff.
You will winnow them the wind will pick them up and a gale will blow them away. But you will rejoice in the Lord and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
The poor and needy search for water but there is none their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the Lord will answer them I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
I will make rivers flow on barren heights and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into springs.
I will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia the myrtle and the olive. I will set pines in the wasteland the fir and the cypress together
so that people may see and know may consider and understand that the hand of the Lord has done this that the Holy One of Israel has created it.
Present your case says the Lord. Set forth your arguments says Jacobs King.
Bring in your idols to tell us what is going to happen. Tell us what the former things were so that we may consider them and know their final outcome. Or declare to us the things to come
tell us what the future holds so we may know that you are gods. Do something whether good or bad so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear.
But you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless he who chooses you is detestable.
Here is my servant whom I uphold my chosen one in whom I delight I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations.
He will not shout or cry out or raise his voice in the streets.
A bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice
he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands will put their hope.
This is what God the Lord says he who created the heavens and stretched them out who spread out the earth and all that comes out of it who gives breath to its people and life to those who walk on it
I the Lord have called you in righteousness I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles
to open eyes that are blind to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.
I am the Lord that is my name! I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols.
See the former things have taken place and new things I declare before they spring into being I announce them to you.
Sing to the Lord a new song his praise from the ends of the earth you who go down to the sea and all that is in it you islands and all who live in them.
Let the desert and its towns raise their voices let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy let them shout from the mountaintops.
Let them give glory to the Lord and proclaim his praise in the islands.
The Lord will march out like a mighty man like a warrior he will stir up his zeal with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies.
For a long time I have kept silent I have been quiet and held myself back. But now like a woman in childbirth I cry out I gasp and pant.
I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools.
I will lead the blind by ways they have not known along unfamiliar paths I will guide them I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do I will not forsake them.
But those who trust in idols who say to images You are our gods will be turned back in utter shame.
Hear you deaf look you blind and see!
Who is blind but my servant and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me blind like the servant of the Lord?
You have seen many things but have paid no attention your ears are open but you hear nothing.
It pleased the Lord for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious.
But this is a people plundered and looted all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder with no one to rescue them they have been made loot with no one to say Send them back.
Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come?
Who handed Jacob over to become loot and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the Lord against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways they did not obey his law.
So he poured out on them his burning anger the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames yet they did not understand it consumed them but they did not take it to heart.
But now this is what the Lord says he who created you O Jacob he who formed you O Israel Fear not for I have redeemed you I have summoned you by name you are mine.
When you pass through the waters I will be with you and when you pass through the rivers they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire you will not be burned the flames will not set you ablaze.
For I am the Lord your God the Holy One of Israel your Savior I give Egypt for your ransom Cush and Seba in your stead.
Since you are precious and honored in my sight and because I love you I will give men in exchange for you and people in exchange for your life.
Do not be afraid for I am with you I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west.
I will say to the north Give them up! and to the south Do not hold them back. Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth
everyone who is called by my name whom I created for my glory whom I formed and made.
Lead out those who have eyes but are blind who have ears but are deaf.
All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Which of them foretold this and proclaimed to us the former things? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right so that others may hear and say It is true.
You are my witnesses declares the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed nor will there be one after me.
I even I am the Lord and apart from me there is no savior.
I have revealed and saved and proclaimed I and not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses declares the Lord that I am God.
Yes and from ancient days I am he. No one can deliver out of my hand. When I act who can reverse it?
This is what the Lord says your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel For your sake I will send to Babylon and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians in the ships in which they took pride.
I am the Lord your Holy One Israels Creator your King.
This is what the Lord says he who made a way through the sea a path through the mighty waters
who drew out the chariots and horses the army and reinforcements together and they lay there never to rise again extinguished snuffed out like a wick
Forget the former things do not dwell on the past.
See I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.
The wild animals honor me the jackals and the owls because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland to give drink to my people my chosen
the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
Yet you have not called upon me O Jacob you have not wearied yourselves for me O Israel.
You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense.
You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses.
I even I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake and remembers your sins no more.
Review the past for me let us argue the matter together state the case for your innocence.
Your first father sinned your spokesmen rebelled against me.
So I will disgrace the dignitaries of your temple and I will consign Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.
But now listen O Jacob my servant Israel whom I have chosen.
This is what the Lord says he who made you who formed you in the womb and who will help you Do not be afraid O Jacob my servant Jeshurun whom I have chosen.
For I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring and my blessing on your descendants.
They will spring up like grass in a meadow like poplar trees by flowing streams.
One will say I belong to the Lord another will call himself by the name of Jacob still another will write on his hand The Lords and will take the name Israel.
This is what the Lord says Israels King and Redeemer the Lord Almighty I am the first and I am the last apart from me there is no God.
Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I established my ancient people and what is yet to come yes let him foretell what will come.
Do not tremble do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No there is no other Rock I know not one.
All who make idols are nothing and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind they are ignorant to their own shame.
Who shapes a god and casts an idol which can profit him nothing?
He and his kind will be put to shame craftsmen are nothing but men. Let them all come together and take their stand they will be brought down to terror and infamy.
The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals he shapes an idol with hammers he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength he drinks no water and grows faint.
The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in the form of man of man in all his glory that it may dwell in a shrine.
He cut down cedars or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest or planted a pine and the rain made it grow.
It is mans fuel for burning some of it he takes and warms himself he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it he makes an idol and bows down to it.
Half of the wood he burns in the fire over it he prepares his meal he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says Ah! I am warm I see the fire.
From the rest he makes a god his idol he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says Save me you are my god.
They know nothing they understand nothing their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see and their minds closed so they cannot understand.
No one stops to think no one has the knowledge or understanding to say Half of it I used for fuel I even baked bread over its coals I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?
He feeds on ashes a deluded heart misleads him he cannot save himself or say Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?
Remember these things O Jacob for you are my servant O Israel. I have made you you are my servant O Israel I will not forget you.
I have swept away your offenses like a cloud your sins like the morning mist. Return to me for I have redeemed you.
Sing for joy O heavens for the Lord has done this shout aloud O earth beneath. Burst into song you mountains you forests and all your trees for the Lord has redeemed Jacob he displays his glory in Israel.
This is what the Lord says your Redeemer who formed you in the womb I am the Lord who has made all things who alone stretched out the heavens who spread out the earth by myself
This is what the Lord says to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut
I will go before you and will level the mountains I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron.
I will give you the treasures of darkness riches stored in secret places so that you may know that I am the Lord the God of Israel who summons you by name.
For the sake of Jacob my servant of Israel my chosen I summon you by name and bestow on you a title of honor though you do not acknowledge me.
I am the Lord and there is no other apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you though you have not acknowledged me
so that from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting men may know there is none besides me. I am the Lord and there is no other.
I form the light and create darkness I bring prosperity and create disaster I the Lord do all these things.
You heavens above rain down righteousness let the clouds shower it down. Let the earth open wide let salvation spring up let righteousness grow with it I the Lord have created it.
Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds on the ground. Does the clay say to the potter What are you making? Does your work say He has no hands?
Woe to him who says to his father What have you begotten? or to his mother What have you brought to birth?
This is what the Lord says the Holy One of Israel and its Maker Concerning things to come do you question me about my children or give me orders about the work of my hands?
It is I who made the earth and created mankind upon it. My own hands stretched out the heavens I marshaled their starry hosts.
Bel bows down Nebo stoops low their idols are borne by beasts of burden. The images that are carried about are burdensome a burden for the weary.
They stoop and bow down together unable to rescue the burden they themselves go off into captivity.
Listen to me O house of Jacob all you who remain of the house of Israel you whom I have upheld since you were conceived and have carried since your birth.
Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you I will sustain you and I will rescue you.
To whom will you compare me or count me equal? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared?
Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god and they bow down and worship it.
They lift it to their shoulders and carry it they set it up in its place and there it stands. From that spot it cannot move. Though one cries out to it it does not answer it cannot save him from his troubles.
Remember this fix it in mind take it to heart you rebels.
Remember the former things those of long ago I am God and there is no other I am God and there is none like me.
I make known the end from the beginning from ancient times what is still to come. I say My purpose will stand and I will do all that I please.
From the east I summon a bird of prey from a faroff land a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said that will I bring about what I have planned that will I do.
Listen to me you stubbornhearted you who are far from righteousness.
I am bringing my righteousness near it is not far away and my salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion my splendor to Israel.
Go down sit in the dust Virgin Daughter of Babylon sit on the ground without a throne Daughter of the Babylonians. No more will you be called tender or delicate.
Take millstones and grind flour take off your veil. Lift up your skirts bare your legs and wade through the streams.
Your nakedness will be exposed and your shame uncovered. I will take vengeance I will spare no one.
Our Redeemerthe Lord Almighty is his name is the Holy One of Israel.
Sit in silence go into darkness Daughter of the Babylonians no more will you be called queen of kingdoms.
I was angry with my people and desecrated my inheritance I gave them into your hand and you showed them no mercy. Even on the aged you laid a very heavy yoke.
You said I will continue forever the eternal queen! But you did not consider these things or reflect on what might happen.
Now then listen you wanton creature lounging in your security and saying to yourself I am and there is none besides me. I will never be a widow or suffer the loss of children.
Both of these will overtake you in a moment on a single day loss of children and widowhood. They will come upon you in full measure in spite of your many sorceries and all your potent spells.
You have trusted in your wickedness and have said No one sees me. Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you when you say to yourself I am and there is none besides me.
Disaster will come upon you and you will not know how to conjure it away. A calamity will fall upon you that you cannot ward off with a ransom a catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you.
Keep on then with your magic spells and with your many sorceries which you have labored at since childhood. Perhaps you will succeed perhaps you will cause terror.
All the counsel you have received has only worn you out! Let your astrologers come forward those stargazers who make predictions month by month let them save you from what is coming upon you.
Surely they are like stubble the fire will burn them up. They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. Here are no coals to warm anyone here is no fire to sit by.
That is all they can do for you these you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood. Each of them goes on in his error there is not one that can save you.
Listen to this O house of Jacob you who are called by the name of Israel and come from the line of Judah you who take oaths in the name of the Lord and invoke the God of Israel but not in truth or righteousness
you who call yourselves citizens of the holy city and rely on the God of Israel the Lord Almighty is his name
I foretold the former things long ago my mouth announced them and I made them known then suddenly I acted and they came to pass.
For I knew how stubborn you were the sinews of your neck were iron your forehead was bronze.
Therefore I told you these things long ago before they happened I announced them to you so that you could not say My idols did them my wooden image and metal god ordained them.
You have heard these things look at them all. Will you not admit them? From now on I will tell you of new things of hidden things unknown to you.
They are created now and not long ago you have not heard of them before today. So you cannot say Yes I knew of them.
You have neither heard nor understood from of old your ear has not been open. Well do I know how treacherous you are you were called a rebel from birth.
For my own names sake I delay my wrath for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you so as not to cut you off.
See I have refined you though not as silver I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
For my own sake for my own sake I do this. How can I let myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another.
Listen to me O Jacob Israel whom I have called I am he I am the first and I am the last.
My own hand laid the foundations of the earth and my right hand spread out the heavens when I summon them they all stand up together.
Come together all of you and listen Which of the idols has foretold these things? The Lords chosen ally will carry out his purpose against Babylon his arm will be against the Babylonians.
I even I have spoken yes I have called him. I will bring him and he will succeed in his mission.
Come near me and listen to this From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret at the time it happens I am there. And now the Sovereign Lord has sent me with his Spirit.
This is what the Lord says your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel I am the Lord your God who teaches you what is best for you who directs you in the way you should go.
If only you had paid attention to my commands your peace would have been like a river your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
Your descendants would have been like the sand your children like its numberless grains their name would never be cut off nor destroyed from before me.
Leave Babylon flee from the Babylonians! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth say The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob.
They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts he made water flow for them from the rock he split the rock and water gushed out.
There is no peace says the Lord for the wicked.
Listen to me you islands hear this you distant nations Before I was born the Lord called me from my birth he has made mention of my name.
He made my mouth like a sharpened sword in the shadow of his hand he hid me he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.
He said to me You are my servant Israel in whom I will display my splendor.
But I said I have labored to no purpose I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing. Yet what is due me is in the Lords hand and my reward is with my God.
And now the Lord says he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself for I am honored in the eyes of the Lord and my God has been my strength
he says It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.
This is what the Lord says the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation to the servant of rulers Kings will see you and rise up princes will see and bow down because of the Lord who is faithful the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.
This is what the Lord says In the time of my favor I will answer you and in the day of salvation I will help you I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances
to say to the captives Come out and to those in darkness Be free! They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill.
They will neither hunger nor thirst nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water.
This is what the Lord says Where is your mothers certificate of divorce with which I sent her away? Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Because of your sins you were sold because of your transgressions your mother was sent away.
When I came why was there no one? When I called why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to ransom you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea I turn rivers into a desert their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.
I clothe the sky with darkness and make sackcloth its covering.
The Sovereign Lord has given me an instructed tongue to know the word that sustains the weary. He wakens me morning by morning wakens my ear to listen like one being taught.
The Sovereign Lord has opened my ears and I have not been rebellious I have not drawn back.
I offered my back to those who beat me my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting.
Because the Sovereign Lord helps me I will not be disgraced. Therefore have I set my face like flint and I know I will not be put to shame.
He who vindicates me is near. Who then will bring charges against me? Let us face each other! Who is my accuser? Let him confront me!
It is the Sovereign Lord who helps me. Who is he that will condemn me? They will all wear out like a garment the moths will eat them up.
Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the word of his servant? Let him who walks in the dark who has no light trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God.
But now all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches go walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. This is what you shall receive from my hand You will lie down in torment.
Listen to me you who pursue righteousness and who seek the Lord Look to the rock from which you were cut and to the quarry from which you were hewn
look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gave you birth. When I called him he was but one and I blessed him and made him many.
The Lord will surely comfort Zion and will look with compassion on all her ruins he will make her deserts like Eden her wastelands like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness will be found in her thanksgiving and the sound of singing.
Listen to me my people hear me my nation The law will go out from me my justice will become a light to the nations.
My righteousness draws near speedily my salvation is on the way and my arm will bring justice to the nations. The islands will look to me and wait in hope for my arm.
Lift up your eyes to the heavens look at the earth beneath the heavens will vanish like smoke the earth will wear out like a garment and its inhabitants die like flies. But my salvation will last forever my righteousness will never fail.
Hear me you who know what is right you people who have my law in your hearts Do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their insults.
For the moth will eat them up like a garment the worm will devour them like wool. But my righteousness will last forever my salvation through all generations.
Awake awake! Clothe yourself with strength O arm of the Lord awake as in days gone by as in generations of old. Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces who pierced that monster through?
Was it not you who dried up the sea the waters of the great deep who made a road in the depths of the sea so that the redeemed might cross over?
The ransomed of the Lord will return. They will enter Zion with singing everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
I even I am he who comforts you. Who are you that you fear mortal men the sons of men who are but grass
that you forget the Lord your Maker who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth that you live in constant terror every day because of the wrath of the oppressor who is bent on destruction? For where is the wrath of the oppressor?
The cowering prisoners will soon be set free they will not die in their dungeon nor will they lack bread.
Awake awake O Zion clothe yourself with strength. Put on your garments of splendor O Jerusalem the holy city. The uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again.
Shake off your dust rise up sit enthroned O Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck O captive Daughter of Zion.
For this is what the Lord says You were sold for nothing and without money you will be redeemed.
For this is what the Sovereign Lord says At first my people went down to Egypt to live lately Assyria has oppressed them.
And now what do I have here? declares the Lord. For my people have been taken away for nothing and those who rule them mock declares the Lord. And all day long my name is constantly blasphemed.
Therefore my people will know my name therefore in that day they will know that it is I who foretold it. Yes it is I.
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news who proclaim peace who bring good tidings who proclaim salvation who say to Zion Your God reigns!
Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices together they shout for joy. When the Lord returns to Zion they will see it with their own eyes.
Burst into songs of joy together you ruins of Jerusalem for the Lord has comforted his people he has redeemed Jerusalem.
The Lord will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
Depart depart go out from there! Touch no unclean thing! Come out from it and be pure you who carry the vessels of the Lord.
Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
He grew up before him like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
He was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him not.
Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows yet we considered him stricken by God smitten by him and afflicted.
But he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed.
We all like sheep have gone astray each of us has turned to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
He was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth he was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is silent so he did not open his mouth.
By oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
He was assigned a grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth.
Yet it was the Lords will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the Lord makes his life a guilt offering he will see his offspring and prolong his days and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.
After the suffering of his soul he will see the light of life and be satisfied by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities.
Therefore I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with the strong because he poured out his life unto death and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.
Sing O barren woman you who never bore a child burst into song shout for joy you who were never in labor because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband says the Lord.
Enlarge the place of your tent stretch your tent curtains wide do not hold back lengthen your cords strengthen your stakes.
For you will spread out to the right and to the left your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate cities.
Do not be afraid you will not suffer shame. Do not fear disgrace you will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.
For your Maker is your husband the Lord Almighty is his name the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer he is called the God of all the earth.
The Lord will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit a wife who married young only to be rejected says your God.
For a brief moment I abandoned you but with deep compassion I will bring you back.
In a surge of anger I hid my face from you for a moment but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you says the Lord your Redeemer.
To me this is like the days of Noah when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you never to rebuke you again.
Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed says the Lord who has compassion on you.
O afflicted city lashed by storms and not comforted I will build you with stones of turquoise your foundations with sapphires.
I will make your battlements of rubies your gates of sparkling jewels and all your walls of precious stones.
Come all you who are thirsty come to the waters and you who have no money come buy and eat! Come buy wine and milk without money and without cost.
Why spend money on what is not bread and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen listen to me and eat what is good and your soul will delight in the richest of fare.
Give ear and come to me hear me that your soul may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you my faithful love promised to David.
See I have made him a witness to the peoples a leader and commander of the peoples.
Surely you will summon nations you know not and nations that do not know you will hasten to you because of the Lord your God the Holy One of Israel for he has endowed you with splendor.
Seek the Lord while he may be found call on him while he is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to the Lord and he will have mercy on him and to our God for he will freely pardon.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways declares the Lord.
As the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
As the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater
so is my word that goes out from my mouth It will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
This is what the Lord says Maintain justice and do what is right for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
Blessed is the man who does this the man who holds it fast who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it and keeps his hand from doing any evil.
Let no foreigner who has bound himself to the Lord say The Lord will surely exclude me from his people. And let not any eunuch complain I am only a dry tree.
For this is what the Lord says To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant
to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
And foreigners who bind themselves to the Lord to serve him to love the name of the Lord and to worship him all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant
these I will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.
The Sovereign Lord declares he who gathers the exiles of Israel I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered.
Come all you beasts of the field come and devour all you beasts of the forest!
Israels watchmen are blind they all lack knowledge they are all mute dogs they cannot bark they lie around and dream they love to sleep.
They are dogs with mighty appetites they never have enough. They are shepherds who lack understanding they all turn to their own way each seeks his own gain.
Come each one cries let me get wine! Let us drink our fill of beer! And tomorrow will be like today or even far better.
The righteous perish and no one ponders it in his heart devout men are taken away and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.
Those who walk uprightly enter into peace they find rest as they lie in death.
But youcome here you sons of a sorceress you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels the offspring of liars?
You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags.
The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion they they are your lot. Yes to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In the light of these things should I relent?
You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill there you went up to offer your sacrifices.
Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me you uncovered your bed you climbed into it and opened it wide you made a pact with those whose beds you love and you looked on their nakedness.
You went to Molech with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away you descended to the grave itself!
You were wearied by all your ways but you would not say It is hopeless. You found renewal of your strength and so you did not faint.
Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have been false to me and have neither remembered me nor pondered this in your hearts? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me?
I will expose your righteousness and your works and they will not benefit you.
When you cry out for help let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry all of them off a mere breath will blow them away. But the man who makes me his refuge will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.
Shout it aloud do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the house of Jacob their sins.
For day after day they seek me out they seem eager to know my ways as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them.
Why have we fasted they say and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves and you have not noticed? Yet on the day of your fasting you do as you please and exploit all your workers.
Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.
Is this the kind of fast I have chosen only a day for a man to humble himself? Is it only for bowing ones head like a reed and for lying on sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast a day acceptable to the Lord?
Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?
Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter when you see the naked to clothe him and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
Then your light will break forth like the dawn and your healing will quickly appear then your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.
Then you will call and the Lord will answer you will cry for help and he will say Here am I. If you do away with the yoke of oppression with the pointing finger and malicious talk
and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like the noonday.
The Lord will guide you always he will satisfy your needs in a sunscorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a wellwatered garden like a spring whose waters never fail.
Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the ageold foundations you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.
If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lords holy day honorable and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words
then you will find your joy in the Lord and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob. The mouth of the Lord has spoken.
Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save nor his ear too dull to hear.
But your iniquities have separated you from your God your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear.
For your hands are stained with blood your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken lies and your tongue mutters wicked things.
No one calls for justice no one pleads his case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments and speak lies they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spiders web. Whoever eats their eggs will die and when one is broken an adder is hatched.
Their cobwebs are useless for clothing they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds and acts of violence are in their hands.
Their feet rush into sin they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts ruin and destruction mark their ways.
The way of peace they do not know there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads no one who walks in them will know peace.
So justice is far from us and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light but all is darkness for brightness but we walk in deep shadows.
Like the blind we grope along the wall feeling our way like men without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight among the strong we are like the dead.
We all growl like bears we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice but find none for deliverance but it is far away.
For our offenses are many in your sight and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us and we acknowledge our iniquities
rebellion and treachery against the Lord turning our backs on our God fomenting oppression and revolt uttering lies our hearts have conceived.
So justice is driven back and righteousness stands at a distance truth has stumbled in the streets honesty cannot enter.
Truth is nowhere to be found and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The Lord looked and was displeased that there was no justice.
He saw that there was no one he was appalled that there was no one to intervene so his own arm worked salvation for him and his own righteousness sustained him.
He put on righteousness as his breastplate and the helmet of salvation on his head he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.
According to what they have done so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes he will repay the islands their due.
From the west men will fear the name of the Lord and from the rising of the sun they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pentup flood that the breath of the Lord drives along.
The Redeemer will come to Zion to those in Jacob who repent of their sins declares the Lord.
As for me this is my covenant with them says the Lord. My Spirit who is on you and my words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children or from the mouths of their descendants from this time on and forever says the Lord.
Arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.
See darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples but the Lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you.
Nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
Lift up your eyes and look about you All assemble and come to you your sons come from afar and your daughters are carried on the arm.
Then you will look and be radiant your heart will throb and swell with joy the wealth on the seas will be brought to you to you the riches of the nations will come.
Herds of camels will cover your land young camels of Midian and Ephah. And all from Sheba will come bearing gold and incense and proclaiming the praise of the Lord.
All Kedars flocks will be gathered to you the rams of Nebaioth will serve you they will be accepted as offerings on my altar and I will adorn my glorious temple.
Who are these that fly along like clouds like doves to their nests?
Surely the islands look to me in the lead are the ships of Tarshish bringing your sons from afar with their silver and gold to the honor of the Lord your God the Holy One of Israel for he has endowed you with splendor.
Foreigners will rebuild your walls and their kings will serve you. Though in anger I struck you in favor I will show you compassion.
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners
to proclaim the year of the Lords favor and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all who mourn
and provide for those who grieve in Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes the oil of gladness instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.
They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations.
Aliens will shepherd your flocks foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
And you will be called priests of the Lord you will be named ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations and in their riches you will boast.
Instead of their shame my people will receive a double portion and instead of disgrace they will rejoice in their inheritance and so they will inherit a double portion in their land and everlasting joy will be theirs.
For I the Lord love justice I hate robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness I will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them.
Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the Lord has blessed.
I delight greatly in the Lord my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.
For Zions sake I will not keep silent for Jerusalems sake I will not remain quiet till her righteousness shines out like the dawn her salvation like a blazing torch.
The nations will see your righteousness and all kings your glory you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the Lord will bestow.
You will be a crown of splendor in the Lords hand a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
No longer will they call you Deserted or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah and your land Beulah for the Lord will take delight in you and your land will be married.
As a young man marries a maiden so will your sons marry you as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride so will your God rejoice over you.
I have posted watchmen on your walls O Jerusalem they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord give yourselves no rest
and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
The Lord has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled
but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.
Pass through pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations.
The Lord has made proclamation to the ends of the earth Say to the Daughter of Zion See your Savior comes! See his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him. 
They will be called the Holy People the Redeemed of the Lord and you will be called Sought After the City No Longer Deserted.
Who is this coming from Edom from Bozrah with his garments stained crimson? Who is this robed in splendor striding forward in the greatness of his strength? It is I speaking in righteousness mighty to save.
Why are your garments red like those of one treading the winepress?
I have trodden the winepress alone from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath their blood spattered my garments and I stained all my clothing.
For the day of vengeance was in my heart and the year of my redemption has come.
I looked but there was no one to help I was appalled that no one gave support so my own arm worked salvation for me and my own wrath sustained me.
I trampled the nations in my anger in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.
I will tell of the kindnesses of the Lord the deeds for which he is to be praised according to all the Lord has done for us yes the many good things he has done for the house of Israel according to his compassion and many kindnesses.
He said Surely they are my people sons who will not be false to me and so he became their Savior.
In all their distress he too was distressed and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them.
Then his people recalled the days of old the days of Moses and his people where is he who brought them through the sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them
Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down that the mountains would tremble before you!
As when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to quake before you!
For when you did awesome things that we did not expect you came down and the mountains trembled before you.
Since ancient times no one has heard no ear has perceived no eye has seen any God besides you who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
You come to the help of those who gladly do right who remember your ways. But when we continued to sin against them you were angry. How then can we be saved?
All of us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags we all shrivel up like a leaf and like the wind our sins sweep us away.
No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins.
Yet O Lord you are our Father. We are the clay you are the potter we are all the work of your hand.
Do not be angry beyond measure O Lord do not remember our sins forever. Oh look upon us we pray for we are all your people.
Your sacred cities have become a desert even Zion is a desert Jerusalem a desolation.
Our holy and glorious temple where our fathers praised you has been burned with fire and all that we treasured lies in ruins.
After all this O Lord will you hold yourself back? Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure?
I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me I was found by those who did not seek me. To a nation that did not call on my name I said Here am I here am I.
All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people who walk in ways not good pursuing their own imaginations
a people who continually provoke me to my very face offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick
who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil who eat the flesh of pigs and whose pots hold broth of unclean meat
who say Keep away dont come near me for I am too sacred for you! Such people are smoke in my nostrils a fire that keeps burning all day.
See it stands written before me I will not keep silent but will pay back in full I will pay it back into their laps
both your sins and the sins of your fathers says the Lord. Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds.
This is what the Lord says As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say Dont destroy it there is yet some good in it so will I do in behalf of my servants I will not destroy them all.
I will bring forth descendants from Jacob and from Judah those who will possess my mountains my chosen people will inherit them and there will my servants live.
Sharon will become a pasture for flocks and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds for my people who seek me.
But as for you who forsake the Lord and forget my holy mountain who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny
I will destine you for the sword and you will all bend down for the slaughter for I called but you did not answer I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says My servants will eat but you will go hungry my servants will drink but you will go thirsty my servants will rejoice but you will be put to shame.
My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.
You will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse the Sovereign Lord will put you to death but to his servants he will give another name.
Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.
Behold I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered nor will they come to mind.
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.
I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.
Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days or an old man who does not live out his years he who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth he who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed.
They will build houses and dwell in them they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
No longer will they build houses and others live in them or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree so will be the days of my people my chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands.
They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune for they will be a people blessed by the Lord they and their descendants with them.
This is what the Lord says Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be?
Has not my hand made all these things and so they came into being? declares the Lord. This is the one I esteem he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.
But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man and whoever offers a lamb like one who breaks a dogs neck whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pigs blood and whoever burns memorial incense like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways and their souls delight in their abominations
so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring upon them what they dread. For when I called no one answered when I spoke no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.
Hear the word of the Lord you who tremble at his word Your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said Let the Lord be glorified that we may see your joy! Yet they will be put to shame.
Hear that uproar from the city hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the Lord repaying his enemies all they deserve.
Before she goes into labor she gives birth before the pains come upon her she delivers a son.
Who has ever heard of such a thing? Who has ever seen such things? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.
Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery? says the Lord. Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery? says your God.
Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her all you who love her rejoice greatly with her all you who mourn over her.
For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance.
For this is what the Lord says I will extend peace to her like a river and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.
As a mother comforts her child so will I comfort you and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.
When you see this your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass the hand of the Lord will be made known to his servants but his fury will be shown to his foes.
See the Lord is coming with fire and his chariots are like a whirlwind he will bring down his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire.
For with fire and with his sword the Lord will execute judgment upon all men and many will be those slain by the Lord.
Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens following the one in the midst of those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable thingsthey will meet their end together declares the Lord.
And I because of their actions and their imaginations am about to come and gather all nations and tongues and they will come and see my glory.
The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah
and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
The word of the Lord came to me saying
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you before you were born I set you apart I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.
Ah Sovereign Lord I said I do not know how to speak I am only a child.
But the Lord said to me Do not say I am only a child. You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.
Do not be afraid of them for I am with you and will rescue you declares the Lord.
Then the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me Now I have put my words in your mouth.
See today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down to destroy and overthrow to build and to plant.
The word of the Lord came to me What do you see Jeremiah? I see the branch of an almond tree I replied.
The Lord said to me You have seen correctly for I am watching to see that my word is fulfilled.
The word of the Lord came to me again What do you see? I see a boiling pot tilting away from the north I answered.
The Lord said to me From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land.
I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms declares the Lord. Their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah.
I will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made.
Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them or I will terrify you before them.
Today I have made you a fortified city an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole landagainst the kings of Judah its officials its priests and the people of the land.
They will fight against you but will not overcome you for I am with you and will rescue you declares the Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem  I remember the devotion of your youth how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not sown.
Israel was holy to the Lord the firstfruits of his harvest all who devoured her were held guilty and disaster overtook them  declares the Lord.
Hear the word of the Lord O house of Jacob all you clans of the house of Israel.
This is what the Lord says What fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.
They did not ask Where is the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness through a land of deserts and rifts a land of drought and darkness a land where no one travels and no one lives?
I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable.
The priests did not ask Where is the Lord? Those who deal with the law did not know me the leaders rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal following worthless idols.
Therefore I bring charges against you again declares the Lord. And I will bring charges against your childrens children.
Cross over to the coasts of Kittim and look send to Kedar and observe closely see if there has ever been anything like this
Has a nation ever changed its gods?  But my people have exchanged their Glory for worthless idols.
Be appalled at this O heavens and shudder with great horror declares the Lord.
My people have committed two sins They have forsaken me the spring of living water and have dug their own cisterns broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
Is Israel a servant a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder?
Lions have roared they have growled at him. They have laid waste his land his towns are burned and deserted.
Also the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head.
Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the Lord your God when he led you in the way?
Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Shihor? And why go to Assyria to drink water from the River?
Your wickedness will punish you your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the Lord your God and have no awe of me declares the Lord the Lord Almighty.
Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds you said I will not serve you! Indeed on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.
I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt wild vine?
Although you wash yourself with soda and use an abundance of soap the stain of your guilt is still before me declares the Sovereign Lord.
How can you say I am not defiled I have not run after the Baals? See how you behaved in the valley consider what you have done. You are a swift shecamel running here and there
a wild donkey accustomed to the desert sniffing the wind in her craving in her heat who can restrain her? Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating time they will find her.
If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man should he return to her again? Would not the land be completely defiled? But you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers would you now return to me? declares the Lord.
Look up to the barren heights and see. Is there any place where you have not been ravished? By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers sat like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
Therefore the showers have been withheld and no spring rains have fallen. Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute you refuse to blush with shame.
Have you not just called to me My Father my friend from my youth
will you always be angry? Will your wrath continue forever? This is how you talk but you do all the evil you can.
During the reign of King Josiah the Lord said to me Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there.
I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it.
I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear she also went out and committed adultery.
Because Israels immorality mattered so little to her she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood.
In spite of all this her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart but only in pretense declares the Lord.
The Lord said to me Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah.
Go proclaim this message toward the north  Return faithless Israel declares the Lord I will frown on you no longer for I am merciful declares the Lord I will not be angry forever.
Only acknowledge your guilt you have rebelled against the Lord your God you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree and have not obeyed me  declares the Lord.
Return faithless people declares the Lord for I am your husband. I will choose youone from a town and two from a clanand bring you to Zion.
Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart who will lead you with knowledge and understanding.
In those days when your numbers have increased greatly in the land declares the Lord men will no longer say The ark of the covenant of the Lord. It will never enter their minds or be remembered it will not be missed nor will another one be made.
At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the Lord. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
In those days the house of Judah will join the house of Israel and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your forefathers as an inheritance.
I myself said  How gladly would I treat you like sons and give you a desirable land the most beautiful inheritance of any nation. I thought you would call me Father and not turn away from following me.
But like a woman unfaithful to her husband so you have been unfaithful to me O house of Israel declares the Lord.
A cry is heard on the barren heights the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the Lord their God.
Return faithless people I will cure you of backsliding. Yes we will come to you for you are the Lord our God.
Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception surely in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our fathers labor their flocks and herds their sons and daughters.
Let us lie down in our shame and let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the Lord our God both we and our fathers from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the Lord our God.
If you will return O Israel return to me declares the Lord. If you put your detestable idols out of my sight and no longer go astray
and if in a truthful just and righteous way you swear As surely as the Lord lives then the nations will be blessed by him and in him they will glory.
This is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem Break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns.
Circumcise yourselves to the Lord circumcise your hearts you men of Judah and people of Jerusalem or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done burn with no one to quench it.
Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say Sound the trumpet throughout the land! Cry aloud and say Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities!
Raise the signal to go to Zion! Flee for safety without delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north even terrible destruction.
A lion has come out of his lair a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste your land. Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant.
So put on sackcloth lament and wail for the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned away from us.
In that day declares the Lord the king and the officials will lose heart the priests will be horrified and the prophets will be appalled.
Then I said Ah Sovereign Lord how completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying You will have peace when the sword is at our throats.
At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people but not to winnow or cleanse
a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them.
Look! He advances like the clouds his chariots come like a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! We are ruined!
O Jerusalem wash the evil from your heart and be saved. How long will you harbor wicked thoughts?
A voice is announcing from Dan proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.
Tell this to the nations proclaim it to Jerusalem A besieging army is coming from a distant land raising a war cry against the cities of Judah.
They surround her like men guarding a field because she has rebelled against me  declares the Lord.
Your own conduct and actions have brought this upon you. This is your punishment. How bitter it is! How it pierces to the heart!
Oh my anguish my anguish! I writhe in pain. Oh the agony of my heart! My heart pounds within me I cannot keep silent. For I have heard the sound of the trumpet I have heard the battle cry.
Disaster follows disaster the whole land lies in ruins. In an instant my tents are destroyed my shelter in a moment.
How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
My people are fools they do not know me. They are senseless children they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil they know not how to do good.
I looked at the earth and it was formless and empty and at the heavens and their light was gone.
I looked at the mountains and they were quaking all the hills were swaying.
I looked and there were no people every bird in the sky had flown away.
I looked and the fruitful land was a desert all its towns lay in ruins before the Lord before his fierce anger.
This is what the Lord says The whole land will be ruined though I will not destroy it completely.
Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark because I have spoken and will not relent I have decided and will not turn back.
At the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight. Some go into the thickets some climb up among the rocks. All the towns are deserted no one lives in them.
What are you doing O devastated one? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold? Why shade your eyes with paint? You adorn yourself in vain. Your lovers despise you they seek your life.
I hear a cry as of a woman in labor a groan as of one bearing her first child the cry of the Daughter of Zion gasping for breath stretching out her hands and saying Alas! I am fainting my life is given over to murderers.
Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem look around and consider search through her squares. If you can find but one person who deals honestly and seeks the truth I will forgive this city.
Although they say As surely as the Lord lives still they are swearing falsely.
O Lord do not your eyes look for truth? You struck them but they felt no pain you crushed them but they refused correction. They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent.
I thought These are only the poor they are foolish for they do not know the way of the Lord the requirements of their God.
So I will go to the leaders and speak to them surely they know the way of the Lord the requirements of their God. But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds.
Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them a wolf from the desert will ravage them a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many.
Why should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I supplied all their needs yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes.
They are wellfed lusty stallions each neighing for another mans wife.
Should I not punish them for this? declares the Lord. Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
Go through her vineyards and ravage them but do not destroy them completely. Strip off her branches for these people do not belong to the Lord.
The house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me declares the Lord.
They have lied about the Lord they said He will do nothing! No harm will come to us we will never see sword or famine.
The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them so let what they say be done to them.
Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty says Because the people have spoken these words I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes.
O house of Israel declares the Lord I am bringing a distant nation against you an ancient and enduring nation a people whose language you do not know whose speech you do not understand.
Their quivers are like an open grave all of them are mighty warriors.
They will devour your harvests and food devour your sons and daughters they will devour your flocks and herds devour your vines and fig trees. With the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust.
Yet even in those days declares the Lord I will not destroy you completely.
And when the people ask Why has the Lord our God done all this to us? you will tell them As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.
Announce this to the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah
Hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eyes but do not see who have ears but do not hear
Should you not fear me? declares the Lord. Should you not tremble in my presence? I made the sand a boundary for the sea an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. The waves may roll but they cannot prevail they may roar but they cannot cross it.
But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts they have turned aside and gone away.
They do not say to themselves Let us fear the Lord our God who gives autumn and spring rains in season who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.
Your wrongdoings have kept these away your sins have deprived you of good.
Among my people are wicked men who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch men.
Like cages full of birds their houses are full of deceit they have become rich and powerful
and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it they do not defend the rights of the poor.
Should I not punish them for this? declares the Lord. Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
Flee for safety people of Benjamin! Flee from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa! Raise the signal over Beth Hakkerem! For disaster looms out of the north even terrible destruction.
I will destroy the Daughter of Zion so beautiful and delicate.
Shepherds with their flocks will come against her they will pitch their tents around her each tending his own portion.
Prepare for battle against her! Arise let us attack at noon! But alas the daylight is fading and the shadows of evening grow long.
So arise let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses!
This is what the Lord Almighty says Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. This city must be punished it is filled with oppression.
As a well pours out its water so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction resound in her her sickness and wounds are ever before me.
Take warning O Jerusalem or I will turn away from you and make your land desolate so no one can live in it.
This is what the Lord Almighty says Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine pass your hand over the branches again like one gathering grapes.
To whom can I speak and give warning? Who will listen to me? Their ears are closed so they cannot hear. The word of the Lord is offensive to them they find no pleasure in it.
But I am full of the wrath of the Lord and I cannot hold it in. Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together both husband and wife will be caught in it and the old those weighed down with years.
Their houses will be turned over to others together with their fields and their wives when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land declares the Lord.
From the least to the greatest all are greedy for gain prophets and priests alike all practice deceit.
They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. Peace peace they say when there is no peace.
Are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct? No they have no shame at all they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen they will be brought down when I punish them says the Lord.
This is what the Lord says Stand at the crossroads and look ask for the ancient paths ask where the good way is and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls. But you said We will not walk in it.
I appointed watchmen over you and said Listen to the sound of the trumpet! But you said We will not listen.
Therefore hear O nations observe O witnesses what will happen to them.
Hear O earth I am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law.
What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet calamus from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable your sacrifices do not please me.
Therefore this is what the Lord says I will put obstacles before this people. Fathers and sons alike will stumble over them neighbors and friends will perish.
This is what the Lord says Look an army is coming from the land of the north a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
They are armed with bow and spear they are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses they come like men in battle formation to attack you O Daughter of Zion.
We have heard reports about them and our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us pain like that of a woman in labor.
Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads for the enemy has a sword and there is terror on every side.
O my people put on sackcloth and roll in ashes mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
I have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore that you may observe and test their ways.
They are all hardened rebels going about to slander. They are bronze and iron they all act corruptly.
The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire but the refining goes on in vain the wicked are not purged out.
They are called rejected silver because the Lord has rejected them.
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord
Stand at the gate of the Lords house and there proclaim this message  Hear the word of the Lord all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the Lord.
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Reform your ways and your actions and I will let you live in this place.
Do not trust in deceptive words and say This is the temple of the Lord the temple of the Lord the temple of the Lord!
If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly
if you do not oppress the alien the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm
then I will let you live in this place in the land I gave your forefathers for ever and ever.
But look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless.
 Will you steal and murder commit adultery and perjury burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known
and then come and stand before me in this house which bears my Name and say We are safesafe to do all these detestable things?
Has this house which bears my Name become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the Lord.
 Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.
While you were doing all these things declares the Lord I spoke to you again and again but you did not listen I called you but you did not answer.
Therefore what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name the temple you trust in the place I gave to you and your fathers.
I will thrust you from my presence just as I did all your brothers the people of Ephraim.
So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them do not plead with me for I will not listen to you.
Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
The children gather wood the fathers light the fire and the women knead the dough and make cakes of bread for the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger.
But am I the one they are provoking? declares the Lord. Are they not rather harming themselves to their own shame?
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place on man and beast on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground and it will burn and not be quenched.
 This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Go ahead add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves!
 At that time declares the Lord the bones of the kings and officials of Judah the bones of the priests and prophets and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves.
They will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped. They will not be gathered up or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground.
Wherever I banish them all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life declares the Lord Almighty.
Say to them This is what the Lord says  When men fall down do they not get up? When a man turns away does he not return?
Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away? They cling to deceit they refuse to return.
I have listened attentively but they do not say what is right. No one repents of his wickedness saying What have I done? Each pursues his own course like a horse charging into battle.
Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons and the dove the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration. But my people do not know the requirements of the Lord.
 How can you say We are wise for we have the law of the Lord when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely?
The wise will be put to shame they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the Lord what kind of wisdom do they have?
Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. From the least to the greatest all are greedy for gain prophets and priests alike all practice deceit.
They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. Peace peace they say when there is no peace.
Are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct? No they have no shame at all they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen they will be brought down when they are punished says the Lord.
 I will take away their harvest declares the Lord. There will be no grapes on the vine. There will be no figs on the tree and their leaves will wither. What I have given them will be taken from them. 
Why are we sitting here? Gather together! Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there! For the Lord our God has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink because we have sinned against him.
We hoped for peace but no good has come for a time of healing but there was only terror.
The snorting of the enemys horses is heard from Dan at the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles. They have come to devour the land and everything in it the city and all who live there.
See I will send venomous snakes among you vipers that cannot be charmed and they will bite you declares the Lord.
O my Comforter in sorrow my heart is faint within me.
Listen to the cry of my people from a land far away Is the Lord not in Zion? Is her King no longer there? Why have they provoked me to anger with their images with their worthless foreign idols?
The harvest is past the summer has ended and we are not saved.
Since my people are crushed I am crushed I mourn and horror grips me.
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people?
Oh that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people.
Oh that I had in the desert a lodging place for travelers so that I might leave my people and go away from them for they are all adulterers a crowd of unfaithful people.
They make ready their tongue like a bow to shoot lies it is not by truth that they triumph in the land. They go from one sin to another they do not acknowledge me declares the Lord.
Beware of your friends do not trust your brothers. For every brother is a deceiver and every friend a slanderer.
Friend deceives friend and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongues to lie they weary themselves with sinning.
You live in the midst of deception in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me declares the Lord.
Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says See I will refine and test them for what else can I do because of the sin of my people?
Their tongue is a deadly arrow it speaks with deceit. With his mouth each speaks cordially to his neighbor but in his heart he sets a trap for him.
Should I not punish them for this? declares the Lord. Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?
I will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the desert pastures. They are desolate and untraveled and the lowing of cattle is not heard. The birds of the air have fled and the animals are gone.
I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins a haunt of jackals and I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.
What man is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?
The Lord said It is because they have forsaken my law which I set before them they have not obeyed me or followed my law.
Instead they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts they have followed the Baals as their fathers taught them.
Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says See I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water.
I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known and I will pursue them with the sword until I have destroyed them.
This is what the Lord Almighty says Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come send for the most skillful of them.
Let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids.
The sound of wailing is heard from Zion How ruined we are! How great is our shame! We must leave our land because our houses are in ruins. 
Now O women hear the word of the Lord open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters how to wail teach one another a lament.
Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses it has cut off the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares.
Say This is what the Lord declares  The dead bodies of men will lie like refuse on the open field like cut grain behind the reaper with no one to gather them. 
This is what the Lord says Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches
but let him who boasts boast about this that he understands and knows me that I am the Lord who exercises kindness justice and righteousness on earth for in these I delight declares the Lord.
Hear what the Lord says to you O house of Israel.
This is what the Lord says Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the sky though the nations are terrified by them.
For the customs of the peoples are worthless they cut a tree out of the forest and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.
They adorn it with silver and gold they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.
Like a scarecrow in a melon patch their idols cannot speak they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them they can do no harm nor can they do any good.
No one is like you O Lord you are great and your name is mighty in power.
Who should not revere you O King of the nations? This is your due. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is no one like you.
They are all senseless and foolish they are taught by worthless wooden idols.
Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple all made by skilled workers.
But the Lord is the true God he is the living God the eternal King. When he is angry the earth trembles the nations cannot endure his wrath.
Tell them this These gods who did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens. 
But God made the earth by his power he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
When he thunders the waters in the heavens roar he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
Everyone is senseless and without knowledge every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud they have no breath in them.
They are worthless the objects of mockery when their judgment comes they will perish.
He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these for he is the Maker of all things including Israel the tribe of his inheritance the Lord Almighty is his name.
Gather up your belongings to leave the land you who live under siege.
For this is what the Lord says At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.
Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself This is my sickness and I must endure it.
My tent is destroyed all its ropes are snapped. My sons are gone from me and are no more no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter.
The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the Lord so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered.
Listen! The report is coming a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate a haunt of jackals.
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord
Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem.
Tell them that this is what the Lord the God of Israel says Cursed is the man who does not obey the terms of this covenant
the terms I commanded your forefathers when I brought them out of Egypt out of the ironsmelting furnace. I said Obey me and do everything I command you and you will be my people and I will be your God.
Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your forefathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honeythe land you possess today. I answered Amen Lord.
The Lord said to me Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them.
From the time I brought your forefathers up from Egypt until today I warned them again and again saying Obey me.
But they did not listen or pay attention instead they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep. 
Then the Lord said to me There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem.
They have returned to the sins of their forefathers who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with their forefathers.
Therefore this is what the Lord says I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me I will not listen to them.
The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes.
You have as many gods as you have towns O Judah and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.
Do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.
What is my beloved doing in my temple as she works out her evil schemes with many? Can consecrated meat avert your punishment? When you engage in your wickedness then you rejoice.
The Lord called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form. But with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire and its branches will be broken.
You are always righteous O Lord when I bring a case before you. Yet I would speak with you about your justice Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease?
You have planted them and they have taken root they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips but far from their hearts.
Yet you know me O Lord you see me and test my thoughts about you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered! Set them apart for the day of slaughter!
How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered? Because those who live in it are wicked the animals and birds have perished. Moreover the people are saying He will not see what happens to us.
If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in safe country how will you manage in the thickets by the Jordan?
Your brothers your own family even they have betrayed you they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them though they speak well of you.
I will forsake my house abandon my inheritance I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies.
My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She roars at me therefore I hate her.
Has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack? Go and gather all the wild beasts bring them to devour.
Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland.
It will be made a wasteland parched and desolate before me the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares.
Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other no one will be safe.
They will sow wheat but reap thorns they will wear themselves out but gain nothing. So bear the shame of your harvest because of the Lords fierce anger.
This is what the Lord says As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
But after I uproot them I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to his own inheritance and his own country.
And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name saying As surely as the Lord liveseven as they once taught my people to swear by Baalthen they will be established among my people.
But if any nation does not listen I will completely uproot and destroy it declares the Lord.
This is what the Lord said to me Go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist but do not let it touch water.
So I bought a belt as the Lord directed and put it around my waist.
Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time
Take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist and go now to Perath and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks.
So I went and hid it at Perath as the Lord told me.
Many days later the Lord said to me Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there.
So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it but now it was ruined and completely useless.
Then the word of the Lord came to me
This is what the Lord says In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
These wicked people who refuse to listen to my words who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them will be like this beltcompletely useless!
For as a belt is bound around a mans waist so I bound the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to me declares the Lord to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.
Say to them This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Every wineskin should be filled with wine. And if they say to you Dont we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?
then tell them This is what the Lord says I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land including the kings who sit on Davids throne the priests the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem.
I will smash them one against the other fathers and sons alike declares the Lord. I will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them. 
Hear and pay attention do not be arrogant for the Lord has spoken.
Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings the darkness before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light but he will turn it to thick darkness and change it to deep gloom.
But if you do not listen I will weep in secret because of your pride my eyes will weep bitterly overflowing with tears because the Lords flock will be taken captive.
Say to the king and to the queen mother Come down from your thrones for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads.
The cities in the Negev will be shut up and there will be no one to open them. All Judah will be carried into exile carried completely away.
Lift up your eyes and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you the sheep of which you boasted?
What will you say when the Lord sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies? Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor?
This is the word of the Lord to Jeremiah concerning the drought
Judah mourns her cities languish they wail for the land and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.
The nobles send their servants for water they go to the cisterns but find no water. They return with their jars unfilled dismayed and despairing they cover their heads.
The ground is cracked because there is no rain in the land the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads.
Even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights and pant like jackals their eyesight fails for lack of pasture.
Although our sins testify against us O Lord do something for the sake of your name. For our backsliding is great we have sinned against you.
O Hope of Israel its Savior in times of distress why are you like a stranger in the land like a traveler who stays only a night?
Why are you like a man taken by surprise like a warrior powerless to save? You are among us O Lord and we bear your name do not forsake us!
This is what the Lord says about this people They greatly love to wander they do not restrain their feet. So the Lord does not accept them he will now remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins.
Then the Lord said to me Do not pray for the wellbeing of this people.
Although they fast I will not listen to their cry though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings I will not accept them. Instead I will destroy them with the sword famine and plague.
But I said Ah Sovereign Lord the prophets keep telling them You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed I will give you lasting peace in this place. 
Then the Lord said to me The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions divinations idolatries and the delusions of their own minds.
Therefore this is what the Lord says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name I did not send them yet they are saying No sword or famine will touch this land. Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine.
And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them or their wives their sons or their daughters. I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve.
Speak this word to them  Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing for my virgin daughtermy people has suffered a grievous wound a crushing blow.
If I go into the country I see those slain by the sword if I go into the city I see the ravages of famine. Both prophet and priest have gone to a land they know not. 
Have you rejected Judah completely? Do you despise Zion? Why have you afflicted us so that we cannot be healed? We hoped for peace but no good has come for a time of healing but there is only terror.
O Lord we acknowledge our wickedness and the guilt of our fathers we have indeed sinned against you.
Then the Lord said to me Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence! Let them go!
And if they ask you Where shall we go? tell them This is what the Lord says  Those destined for death to death those for the sword to the sword those for starvation to starvation those for captivity to captivity.
I will send four kinds of destroyers against them declares the Lord the sword to kill and the dogs to drag away and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
I will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.
Who will have pity on you O Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are?
You have rejected me declares the Lord. You keep on backsliding. So I will lay hands on you and destroy you I can no longer show compassion.
I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land. I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people for they have not changed their ways.
I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. At midday I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men suddenly I will bring down on them anguish and terror.
The mother of seven will grow faint and breathe her last. Her sun will set while it is still day she will be disgraced and humiliated. I will put the survivors to the sword before their enemies declares the Lord.
Alas my mother that you gave me birth a man with whom the whole land strives and contends! I have neither lent nor borrowed yet everyone curses me.
The Lord said Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose surely I will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress.
Can a man break iron iron from the northor bronze?
Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder without charge because of all your sins throughout your country.
I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.
You understand O Lord remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. You are longsufferingdo not take me away think of how I suffer reproach for your sake.
When your words came I ate them they were my joy and my hearts delight for I bear your name O Lord God Almighty.
I never sat in the company of revelers never made merry with them I sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation.
Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? Will you be to me like a deceptive brook like a spring that fails?
Therefore this is what the Lord says If you repent I will restore you that you may serve me if you utter worthy not worthless words you will be my spokesman. Let this people turn to you but you must not turn to them.
I will make you a wall to this people a fortified wall of bronze they will fight against you but will not overcome you for I am with you to rescue and save you declares the Lord.
I will save you from the hands of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the cruel.
Then the word of the Lord came to me
You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.
For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers
They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
For this is what the Lord says Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal do not go to mourn or show sympathy because I have withdrawn my blessing my love and my pity from this people declares the Lord.
Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned and no one will cut himself or shave his head for them.
No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the deadnot even for a father or a mothernor will anyone give them a drink to console them.
And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink.
For this is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.
When you tell these people all this and they ask you Why has the Lord decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the Lord our God?
then say to them It is because your fathers forsook me declares the Lord and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law.
But you have behaved more wickedly than your fathers. See how each of you is following the stubbornness of his evil heart instead of obeying me.
So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your fathers have known and there you will serve other gods day and night for I will show you no favor.
However the days are coming declares the Lord when men will no longer say As surely as the Lord lives who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt
but they will say As surely as the Lord lives who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them. For I will restore them to the land I gave their forefathers.
But now I will send for many fishermen declares the Lord and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks.
My eyes are on all their ways they are not hidden from me nor is their sin concealed from my eyes.
I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.
O Lord my strength and my fortress my refuge in time of distress to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say Our fathers possessed nothing but false gods worthless idols that did them no good.
Do men make their own gods? Yes but they are not gods!
Therefore I will teach them this time I will teach them my power and might. Then they will know that my name is the Lord.
Judahs sin is engraved with an iron tool inscribed with a flint point on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.
Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles beside the spreading trees and on the high hills.
My mountain in the land and your wealth and all your treasures I will give away as plunder together with your high places because of sin throughout your country.
Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know for you have kindled my anger and it will burn forever.
This is what the Lord says Cursed is the one who trusts in man who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
He will be like a bush in the wastelands he will not see prosperity when it comes. He will dwell in the parched places of the desert in a salt land where no one lives.
But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord whose confidence is in him.
He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.
The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?
I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind to reward a man according to his conduct according to what his deeds deserve.
Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the man who gains riches by unjust means. When his life is half gone they will desert him and in the end he will prove to be a fool.
A glorious throne exalted from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
O Lord the hope of Israel all who forsake you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the Lord the spring of living water.
Heal me O Lord and I will be healed save me and I will be saved for you are the one I praise.
They keep saying to me Where is the word of the Lord? Let it now be fulfilled!
I have not run away from being your shepherd you know I have not desired the day of despair. What passes my lips is open before you.
Do not be a terror to me you are my refuge in the day of disaster.
Let my persecutors be put to shame but keep me from shame let them be terrified but keep me from terror. Bring on them the day of disaster destroy them with double destruction.
This is what the Lord said to me Go and stand at the gate of the people through which the kings of Judah go in and out stand also at all the other gates of Jerusalem.
Say to them Hear the word of the Lord O kings of Judah and all people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem who come through these gates.
This is what the Lord says Be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem.
Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath but keep the Sabbath day holy as I commanded your forefathers.
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord
Go down to the potters house and there I will give you my message.
So I went down to the potters house and I saw him working at the wheel.
But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands so the potter formed it into another pot shaping it as seemed best to him.
Then the word of the Lord came to me
O house of Israel can I not do with you as this potter does? declares the Lord. Like clay in the hand of the potter so are you in my hand O house of Israel.
If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted torn down and destroyed
and if that nation I warned repents of its evil then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned.
And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted
and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.
Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem This is what the Lord says Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways each one of you and reform your ways and your actions.
But they will reply Its no use. We will continue with our own plans each of us will follow the stubbornness of his evil heart. 
Therefore this is what the Lord says Inquire among the nations Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel.
Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever cease to flow?
This is what the Lord says Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests
and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you
and say Hear the word of the Lord O kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.
For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods they have burned sacrifices in it to gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah ever knew and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
They have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as offerings to Baalsomething I did not command or mention nor did it enter my mind.
So beware the days are coming declares the Lord when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom but the Valley of Slaughter.
 In this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies at the hands of those who seek their lives and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
I will devastate this city and make it an object of scorn all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters and they will eat one anothers flesh during the stress of the siege imposed on them by the enemies who seek their lives.
Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching
and say to them This is what the Lord Almighty says I will smash this nation and this city just as this potters jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here declares the Lord. I will make this city like Topheth.
The houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place Tophethall the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods. 
Jeremiah then returned from Topheth where the Lord had sent him to prophesy and stood in the court of the Lords temple and said to all the people
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Listen! I am going to bring on this city and the villages around it every disaster I pronounced against them because they were stiffnecked and would not listen to my words. 
When the priest Pashhur son of Immer the chief officer in the temple of the Lord heard Jeremiah prophesying these things
he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the Lords temple.
The next day when Pashhur released him from the stocks Jeremiah said to him The Lords name for you is not Pashhur but MagorMissabib.
For this is what the Lord says I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends with your own eyes you will see them fall by the sword of their enemies. I will hand all Judah over to the king of Babylon who will carry them away to Babylon or put them to the sword.
I will hand over to their enemies all the wealth of this cityall its products all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon.
And you Pashhur and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies. 
O Lord you deceived me and I was deceived you overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long everyone mocks me.
Whenever I speak I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. So the word of the Lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long.
But if I say I will not mention him or speak any more in his name his word is in my heart like a fire a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in indeed I cannot.
I hear many whispering Terror on every side! Report him! Lets report him! All my friends are waiting for me to slip saying Perhaps he will be deceived then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him.
But the Lord is with me like a mighty warrior so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced their dishonor will never be forgotten.
O Lord Almighty you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind let me see your vengeance upon them for to you I have committed my cause.
Sing to the Lord! Give praise to the Lord! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said
Inquire now of the Lord for us because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the Lord will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.
But Jeremiah answered them Tell Zedekiah
This is what the Lord the God of Israel says I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city.
I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in anger and fury and great wrath.
I will strike down those who live in this cityboth men and animalsand they will die of a terrible plague.
After that declares the Lord I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague sword and famine to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives. He will put them to the sword he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.
Furthermore tell the people This is what the Lord says See I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death.
Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live he will escape with his life.
I have determined to do this city harm and not good declares the Lord. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will destroy it with fire.
Moreover say to the royal house of Judah Hear the word of the Lord
O house of David this is what the Lord says  Administer justice every morning rescue from the hand of his oppressor the one who has been robbed or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done burn with no one to quench it.
I am against you Jerusalem you who live above this valley on the rocky plateau declares the Lord you who say Who can come against us? Who can enter our refuge?
I will punish you as your deeds deserve declares the Lord. I will kindle a fire in your forests that will consume everything around you. 
This is what the Lord says Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there
Hear the word of the Lord O king of Judah you who sit on Davids throneyou your officials and your people who come through these gates.
This is what the Lord says Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of his oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the alien the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place.
For if you are careful to carry out these commands then kings who sit on Davids throne will come through the gates of this palace riding in chariots and on horses accompanied by their officials and their people.
But if you do not obey these commands declares the Lord I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin. 
For this is what the Lord says about the palace of the king of Judah Though you are like Gilead to me like the summit of Lebanon I will surely make you like a desert like towns not inhabited.
I will send destroyers against you each man with his weapons and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire.
People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city?
And the answer will be Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and have worshiped and served other gods. 
Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss rather weep bitterly for him who is exiled because he will never return nor see his native land again.
For this is what the Lord says about Shallum son of Josiah who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place He will never return.
He will die in the place where they have led him captive he will not see this land again.
Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness his upper rooms by injustice making his countrymen work for nothing not paying them for their labor.
He says I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms. So he makes large windows in it panels it with cedar and decorates it in red.
Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just so all went well with him.
He defended the cause of the poor and needy and so all went well. Is that not what it means to know me? declares the Lord.
But your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion.
Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah They will not mourn for him Alas my brother! Alas my sister! They will not mourn for him Alas my master! Alas his splendor!
He will have the burial of a donkey dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.
Go up to Lebanon and cry out let your voice be heard in Bashan cry out from Abarim for all your allies are crushed.
I warned you when you felt secure but you said I will not listen! This has been your way from your youth you have not obeyed me.
The wind will drive all your shepherds away and your allies will go into exile. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness.
You who live in Lebanon who are nestled in cedar buildings how you will groan when pangs come upon you pain like that of a woman in labor!
As surely as I live declares the Lord even if you Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on my right hand I would still pull you off.
I will hand you over to those who seek your life those you fearto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to the Babylonians.
I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country where neither of you was born and there you both will die.
You will never come back to the land you long to return to.
Is this man Jehoiachin a despised broken pot an object no one wants? Why will he and his children be hurled out cast into a land they do not know?
O land land land hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the Lord says Record this man as if childless a man who will not prosper in his lifetime for none of his offspring will prosper none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.
Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture! declares the Lord.
Therefore this is what the Lord the God of Israel says to the shepherds who tend my people Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done declares the Lord.
I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture where they will be fruitful and increase in number.
I will place shepherds over them who will tend them and they will no longer be afraid or terrified nor will any be missing declares the Lord.
The days are coming declares the Lord when I will raise up to David a righteous Branch a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.
In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called The Lord Our Righteousness.
So then the days are coming declares the Lord when people will no longer say As surely as the Lord lives who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt
but they will say As surely as the Lord lives who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them. Then they will live in their own land.
Concerning the prophets My heart is broken within me all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man like a man overcome by wine because of the Lord and his holy words.
After Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials the craftsmen and the artisans of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord.
One basket had very good figs like those that ripen early the other basket had very poor figs so bad they could not be eaten.
Then the Lord asked me What do you see Jeremiah? Figs I answered. The good ones are very good but the poor ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.
Then the word of the Lord came to me
This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Like these good figs I regard as good the exiles from Judah whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians.
My eyes will watch over them for their good and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down I will plant them and not uproot them.
I will give them a heart to know me that I am the Lord. They will be my people and I will be their God for they will return to me with all their heart.
 But like the poor figs which are so bad they cannot be eaten says the Lord so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt.
I will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth a reproach and a byword an object of ridicule and cursing wherever I banish them.
I will send the sword famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land I gave to them and their fathers. 
The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem
For twentythree yearsfrom the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very daythe word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again but you have not listened.
And though the Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again you have not listened or paid any attention.
They said Turn now each of you from your evil ways and your evil practices and you can stay in the land the Lord gave to you and your fathers for ever and ever.
Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.
But you did not listen to me declares the Lord and you have provoked me with what your hands have made and you have brought harm to yourselves.
Therefore the Lord Almighty says this Because you have not listened to my words
I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon declares the Lord and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn and an everlasting ruin.
I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness the voices of bride and bridegroom the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp.
This whole country will become a desolate wasteland and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
But when the seventy years are fulfilled I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation the land of the Babylonians for their guilt declares the Lord and will make it desolate forever.
I will bring upon that land all the things I have spoken against it all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations.
They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.
This is what the Lord the God of Israel said to me Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
When they drink it they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them.
So I took the cup from the Lords hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it
Jerusalem and the towns of Judah its kings and officials to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn and cursing as they are today
Pharaoh king of Egypt his attendants his officials and all his people
and all the foreign people there all the kings of Uz all the kings of the Philistines 
Edom Moab and Ammon
all the kings of Tyre and Sidon the kings of the coastlands across the sea
Dedan Tema Buz and all who are in distant places
Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah this word came from the Lord
This is what the Lord says Stand in the courtyard of the Lords house and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who come to worship in the house of the Lord. Tell them everything I command you do not omit a word.
Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from his evil way. Then I will relent and not bring on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done.
Say to them This is what the Lord says If you do not listen to me and follow my law which I have set before you
and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent to you again and again 
then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city an object of cursing among all the nations of the earth. 
The priests the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the Lord.
But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the Lord had commanded him to say the priests the prophets and all the people seized him and said You must die!
Why do you prophesy in the Lords name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted? And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.
When the officials of Judah heard about these things they went up from the royal palace to the house of the Lord and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lords house.
Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!
Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard.
Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the Lord your God. Then the Lord will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you.
As for me I am in your hands do with me whatever you think is good and right.
Be assured however that if you put me to death you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.
Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.
Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people
Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah This is what the Lord Almighty says  Zion will be plowed like a field Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.
When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt.
Early in the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord
This is what the Lord said to me Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars and put it on your neck.
Then send word to the kings of Edom Moab Ammon Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
Give them a message for their masters and say This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Tell this to your masters
With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it and I give it to anyone I please.
Now I will hand all your countries over to my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon I will make even the wild animals subject to him.
All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes then many nations and great kings will subjugate him.
  If however any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke I will punish that nation with the sword famine and plague declares the Lord until I destroy it by his hand.
So do not listen to your prophets your diviners your interpreters of dreams your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you You will not serve the king of Babylon.
They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands I will banish you and you will perish.
But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there declares the Lord.  
I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon serve him and his people and you will live.
Why will you and your people die by the sword famine and plague with which the Lord has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you You will not serve the king of Babylon for they are prophesying lies to you.
I have not sent them declares the Lord. They are prophesying lies in my name. Therefore I will banish you and you will perish both you and the prophets who prophesy to you. 
Then I said to the priests and all these people This is what the Lord says Do not listen to the prophets who say Very soon now the articles from the Lords house will be brought back from Babylon. They are prophesying lies to you.
In the fifth month of that same year the fourth year early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur who was from Gibeon said to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the Lords house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon.
I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon declares the Lord for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord.
He said Amen! May the Lord do so! May the Lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the Lords house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
Nevertheless listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people
From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms.
But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the Lord only if his prediction comes true.
Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it
and he said before all the people This is what the Lord says In the same way will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.  At this the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.
Shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
Go and tell Hananiah This is what the Lord says You have broken a wooden yoke but in its place you will get a yoke of iron.
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals. 
Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet Listen Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies.
Therefore this is what the Lord says I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die because you have preached rebellion against the Lord. 
In the seventh month of that same year Hananiah the prophet died.
This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.

He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon
Build houses and settle down plant gardens and eat what they produce.
Marry and have sons and daughters find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there do not decrease.
Also seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it because if it prospers you too will prosper.
Yes this is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have.
They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them declares the Lord.
This is what the Lord says When seventy years are completed for Babylon I will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place.
For I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future.
Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and I will listen to you.
You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.
I will be found by you declares the Lord and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you declares the Lord and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.
You may say The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon
but this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on Davids throne and all the people who remain in this city your countrymen who did not go with you into exile
yes this is what the Lord Almighty says I will send the sword famine and plague against them and I will make them like poor figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.
I will pursue them with the sword famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth and an object of cursing and horror of scorn and reproach among all the nations where I drive them.
For they have not listened to my words declares the Lord words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either declares the Lord.
Therefore hear the word of the Lord all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah who are prophesying lies to you in my name I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and he will put them to death before your very eyes.
Because of them all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse The Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.
For they have done outrageous things in Israel they have committed adultery with their neighbors wives and in my name have spoken lies which I did not tell them to do. I know it and am a witness to it declares the Lord.
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord
This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you.
The days are coming declares the Lord when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their forefathers to possess says the Lord.
These are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah
This is what the Lord says  Cries of fear are heard terror not peace.
Ask and see Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor every face turned deathly pale?
How awful that day will be! None will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob but he will be saved out of it.
 In that day declares the Lord Almighty I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds no longer will foreigners enslave them.
Instead they will serve the Lord their God and David their king whom I will raise up for them.
 So do not fear O Jacob my servant do not be dismayed O Israel declares the Lord. I will surely save you out of a distant place your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security and no one will make him afraid.
I am with you and will save you declares the Lord. Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only with justice I will not let you go entirely unpunished.
This is what the Lord says  Your wound is incurable your injury beyond healing.
There is no one to plead your cause no remedy for your sore no healing for you.
All your allies have forgotten you they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel because your guilt is so great and your sins so many.
Why do you cry out over your wound your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you.
 But all who devour you will be devoured all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered all who make spoil of you I will despoil.
But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds declares the Lord because you are called an outcast Zion for whom no one cares.
This is what the Lord says  I will restore the fortunes of Jacobs tents and have compassion on his dwellings the city will be rebuilt on her ruins and the palace will stand in its proper place.
From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers and they will not be decreased I will bring them honor and they will not be disdained.
Their children will be as in days of old and their community will be established before me I will punish all who oppress them.
Their leader will be one of their own their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me? declares the Lord.
 So you will be my people and I will be your God. 
See the storm of the Lord will burst out in wrath a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.
The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand this.
At that time declares the Lord I will be the God of all the clans of Israel and they will be my people.
This is what the Lord says The people who survive the sword will find favor in the desert I will come to give rest to Israel.
The Lord appeared to us in the past saying I have loved you with an everlasting love I have drawn you with lovingkindness.
I will build you up again and you will be rebuilt O Virgin Israel. Again you will take up your tambourines and go out to dance with the joyful.
Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit.
There will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim Come let us go up to Zion to the Lord our God. 
This is what the Lord says Sing with joy for Jacob shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard and say O Lord save your people the remnant of Israel.
See I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame expectant mothers and women in labor a great throng will return.
They will come with weeping they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble because I am Israels father and Ephraim is my firstborn son.
Hear the word of the Lord O nations proclaim it in distant coastlands He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.
For the Lord will ransom Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they.
They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion they will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord the grain the new wine and the oil the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a wellwatered garden and they will sorrow no more.
Then maidens will dance and be glad young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow.
I will satisfy the priests with abundance and my people will be filled with my bounty declares the Lord.
This is what the Lord says A voice is heard in Ramah mourning and great weeping Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because her children are no more.
This is what the Lord says Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears for your work will be rewarded declares the Lord. They will return from the land of the enemy.
So there is hope for your future declares the Lord. Your children will return to their own land.
I have surely heard Ephraims moaning You disciplined me like an unruly calf and I have been disciplined. Restore me and I will return because you are the Lord my God.
After I strayed I repented after I came to understand I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.
Is not Ephraim my dear son the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him I have great compassion for him declares the Lord.
Set up road signs put up guideposts. Take note of the highway the road that you take. Return O Virgin Israel return to your towns.
How long will you wander O unfaithful daughter? The Lord will create a new thing on earth a woman will surround a man.
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says When I bring them back from captivity the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words The Lord bless you O righteous dwelling O sacred mountain.
People will live together in Judah and all its townsfarmers and those who move about with their flocks.
I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.
At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me.
The days are coming declares the Lord when I will plant the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the offspring of men and of animals.
Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down and to overthrow destroy and bring disaster so I will watch over them to build and to plant declares the Lord.
In those days people will no longer say  The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge.
Instead everyone will die for his own sin whoever eats sour grapeshis own teeth will be set on edge.
The time is coming declares the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt because they broke my covenant though I was a husband to them declares the Lord.
This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time declares the Lord. I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people.
No longer will a man teach his neighbor or a man his brother saying Know the Lord because they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest declares the Lord. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.
This is what the Lord says he who appoints the sun to shine by day who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar the Lord Almighty is his name
Only if these decrees vanish from my sight declares the Lord will the descendants of Israel ever cease to be a nation before me.
This is what the Lord says Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done declares the Lord.
The days are coming declares the Lord when this city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah.
The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.
Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there saying Why do you prophesy as you do? You say This is what the Lord says I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon and he will capture it.
Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hands of the Babylonians but will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes.
He will take Zedekiah to Babylon where he will remain until I deal with him declares the Lord. If you fight against the Babylonians you will not succeed. 
Jeremiah said The word of the Lord came to me
Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say Buy my field at Anathoth because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.
Then just as the Lord had said my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it buy it for yourself. I knew that this was the word of the Lord
so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver.
I signed and sealed the deed had it witnessed and weighed out the silver on the scales.
I took the deed of purchasethe sealed copy containing the terms and conditions as well as the unsealed copy
and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah the son of Mahseiah in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Take these documents both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time.
For this is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Houses fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.
After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah I prayed to the Lord
Ah Sovereign Lord you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.
You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God whose name is the Lord Almighty
great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to all the ways of men you reward everyone according to his conduct and as his deeds deserve.
You performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day both in Israel and among all mankind and have gained the renown that is still yours.
You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror.
You gave them this land you had sworn to give their forefathers a land flowing with milk and honey.
They came in and took possession of it but they did not obey you or follow your law they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster upon them.
See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword famine and plague the city will be handed over to the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened as you now see.
And though the city will be handed over to the Babylonians you O Sovereign Lord say to me Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed. 
While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard the word of the Lord came to him a second time
This is what the Lord says he who made the earth the Lord who formed it and established itthe Lord is his name
Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.
For this is what the Lord the God of Israel says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword
in the fight with the Babylonians They will be filled with the dead bodies of the men I will slay in my anger and wrath. I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness.
 Nevertheless I will bring health and healing to it I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security.
I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity and will rebuild them as they were before.
I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me.
Then this city will bring me renown joy praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.
This is what the Lord says You say about this place It is a desolate waste without men or animals. Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted inhabited by neither men nor animals there will be heard once more
the sounds of joy and gladness the voices of bride and bridegroom and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the Lord saying   Give thanks to the Lord Almighty for the Lord is good his love endures forever. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before says the Lord.
This is what the Lord Almighty says In this place desolate and without men or animalsin all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.
In the towns of the hill country of the western foothills and of the Negev in the territory of Benjamin in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them says the Lord.
 The days are coming declares the Lord when I will fulfill the gracious promise I made to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
 In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from Davids line he will do what is just and right in the land.
In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called The Lord Our Righteousness.
For this is what the Lord says David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel
nor will the priests who are Levites ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices. 
The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
This is what the Lord says If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time
then my covenant with David my servantand my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before mecan be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne.
While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord
This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him This is what the Lord says I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon and he will burn it down.
You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon.
 Yet hear the promise of the Lord O Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the Lord says concerning you You will not die by the sword
you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your fathers the former kings who preceded you so they will make a fire in your honor and lament Alas O master! I myself make this promise declares the Lord. 
Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding outLachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves.
Everyone was to free his Hebrew slaves both male and female no one was to hold a fellow Jew in bondage.
So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed and set them free.
But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
This is what the Lord the God of Israel says I made a covenant with your forefathers when I brought them out of Egypt out of the land of slavery. I said
Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrew who has sold himself to you. After he has served you six years you must let him go free. Your fathers however did not listen to me or pay attention to me.
Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight Each of you proclaimed freedom to his countrymen. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name.
But now you have turned around and profaned my name each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
Therefore this is what the Lord says You have not obeyed me you have not proclaimed freedom for your fellow countrymen. So I now proclaim freedom for you declares the Lordfreedom to fall by the sword plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth.
The men who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces.
This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah
Go to the Recabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the Lord and give them wine to drink.
So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah the son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sonsthe whole family of the Recabites.
I brought them into the house of the Lord into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.
Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the Recabite family and said to them Drink some wine.
But they replied We do not drink wine because our forefather Jonadab son of Recab gave us this command Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine.
Also you must never build houses sow seed or plant vineyards you must never have any of these things but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.
We have obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab son of Recab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine
or built houses to live in or had vineyards fields or crops.
We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jonadab commanded us.
But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land we said Come we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies. So we have remained in Jerusalem.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah saying
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Go and tell the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words? declares the Lord.
Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine because they obey their forefathers command. But I have spoken to you again and again yet you have not obeyed me.
Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your fathers. But you have not paid attention or listened to me.
The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab have carried out the command their forefather gave them but these people have not obeyed me.
Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty the God of Israel says Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them but they did not listen I called to them but they did not answer. 
Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Recabites This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.
Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Jonadab son of Recab will never fail to have a man to serve me. 
In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord
Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now.
Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them each of them will turn from his wicked way then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.
So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the Lord had spoken to him Baruch wrote them on the scroll.
Then Jeremiah told Baruch I am restricted I cannot go to the Lords temple.
So you go to the house of the Lord on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.
Perhaps they will bring their petition before the Lord and each will turn from his wicked ways for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the Lord are great.
Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do at the Lords temple he read the words of the Lord from the scroll.
In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah a time of fasting before the Lord was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah.
From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple Baruch read to all the people at the Lords temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.
When Micaiah son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll
he went down to the secretarys room in the royal palace where all the officials were sitting Elishama the secretary Delaiah son of Shemaiah Elnathan son of Acbor Gemariah son of Shaphan Zedekiah son of Hananiah and all the other officials.
After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll
all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah the son of Shelemiah the son of Cushi to say to Baruch Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come. So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand.
They said to him Sit down please and read it to us. So Baruch read it to them.
When they heard all these words they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch We must report all these words to the king.
Then they asked Baruch Tell us how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?
Yes Baruch replied he dictated all these words to me and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.
Then the officials said to Baruch You and Jeremiah go and hide. Dont let anyone know where you are.
After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him.
Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon he reigned in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim.
Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
King Zedekiah however sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message Please pray to the Lord our God for us.
Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people for he had not yet been put in prison.
Pharaohs army had marched out of Egypt and when the Babylonians who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them they withdrew from Jerusalem.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet
This is what the Lord the God of Israel says Tell the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of me Pharaohs army which has marched out to support you will go back to its own land to Egypt.
Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city they will capture it and burn it down.
This is what the Lord says Do not deceive yourselves thinking The Babylonians will surely leave us. They will not!
Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents they would come out and burn this city down.
After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaohs army
Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there.
But when he reached the Benjamin Gate the captain of the guard whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah arrested him and said You are deserting to the Babylonians!
Thats not true! Jeremiah said. I am not deserting to the Babylonians. But Irijah would not listen to him instead he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary which they had made into a prison.
Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon where he remained a long time.
Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace where he asked him privately Is there any word from the Lord? Yes Jeremiah replied you will be handed over to the king of Babylon.
Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people that you have put me in prison?
Where are your prophets who prophesied to you The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land?
But now my lord the king please listen. Let me bring my petition before you Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary or I will die there.
King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
Shephatiah son of Mattan Gedaliah son of Pashhur Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said
This is what the Lord says Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword famine or plague but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. He will escape with his life he will live.
And this is what the Lord says This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon who will capture it. 
Then the officials said to the king This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city as well as all the people by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.
He is in your hands King Zedekiah answered. The king can do nothing to oppose you.
So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah the kings son which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern it had no water in it only mud and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
But EbedMelech a Cushite an official in the royal palace heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate
EbedMelech went out of the palace and said to him
My lord the king these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.
Then the king commanded EbedMelech the Cushite Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.
So EbedMelech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and wornout clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
EbedMelech the Cushite said to Jeremiah Put these old rags and wornout clothes under your arms to pad the ropes. Jeremiah did so
and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the Lord. I am going to ask you something the king said to Jeremiah. Do not hide anything from me.
Jeremiah said to Zedekiah If I give you an answer will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel you would not listen to me.
But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah As surely as the Lord lives who has given us breath I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who are seeking your life.
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah This is what the Lord God Almighty the God of Israel says If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down you and your family will live.
This is how Jerusalem was taken In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah in the tenth month Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it.
And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiahs eleventh year the city wall was broken through.
Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate NergalSharezer of Samgar NeboSarsekim a chief officer NergalSharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon.
When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them they fled they left the city at night by way of the kings garden through the gate between the two walls and headed toward the Arabah.
But the Babylonian army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath where he pronounced sentence on him.
There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah.
Then he put out Zedekiahs eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
The Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city along with those who had gone over to him and the rest of the people.
But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.
Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard
Take him and look after him dont harm him but do for him whatever he asks.
So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard Nebushazban a chief officer NergalSharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon
sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people.
While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard the word of the Lord came to him
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon.
When the commander of the guard found Jeremiah he said to him The Lord your God decreed this disaster for this place.
And now the Lord has brought it about he has done just as he said he would. All this happened because you people sinned against the Lord and did not obey him.
But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. Come with me to Babylon if you like and I will look after you but if you do not want to then dont come. Look the whole country lies before you go wherever you please.
However before Jeremiah turned to go Nebuzaradan added Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah and live with him among the people or go anywhere else you please. Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go.
So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.
When all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon
they came to Gedaliah at MizpahIshmael son of Nethaniah Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the sons of Ephai the Netophathite and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite and their men.
Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan took an oath to reassure them and their men. Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians he said. Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon and it will go well with you.
I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us but you are to harvest the wine summer fruit and oil and put them in your storage jars and live in the towns you have taken over.
When all the Jews in Moab Ammon Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan as governor over them
they all came back to the land of Judah to Gedaliah at Mizpah from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit.
Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
and said to him Dont you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
Then Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?
But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah Dont do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.
In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama who was of royal blood and had been one of the kings officers came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. While they were eating together there
Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were there.
The day after Gedaliahs assassination before anyone knew about it
eighty men who had shaved off their beards torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem Shiloh and Samaria bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the Lord.
Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them weeping as he went. When he met them he said Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.
When they went into the city Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
But ten of them said to Ishmael Dont kill us! We have wheat and barley oil and honey hidden in a field. So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others.
Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.
Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpahthe kings daughters along with all the others who were left there over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.
When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed
they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon.
When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him they were glad.
All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.
Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the survivors from Mizpah whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after he had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam the soldiers women children and court officials he had brought from Gibeon.
And they went on stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt
to escape the Babylonians. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
Then all the army officers including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah and all the people from the least to the greatest approached
Jeremiah the prophet and said to him Please hear our petition and pray to the Lord your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see though we were once many now only a few are left.
Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.
I have heard you replied Jeremiah the prophet. I will certainly pray to the Lord your God as you have requested I will tell you everything the Lord says and will keep nothing back from you.
Then they said to Jeremiah May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the Lord your God sends you to tell us.
Whether it is favorable or unfavorable we will obey the Lord our God to whom we are sending you so that it will go well with us for we will obey the Lord our God.
Ten days later the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.
So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest.
He said to them This is what the Lord the God of Israel to whom you sent me to present your petition says
If you stay in this land I will build you up and not tear you down I will plant you and not uproot you for I am grieved over the disaster I have inflicted on you.
Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him declares the Lord for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands.
I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.
When Jeremiah finished telling the people all the words of the Lord their Godeverything the Lord had sent him to tell them
Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah You are lying! The Lord our God has not sent you to say You must not go to Egypt to settle there.
But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon.
So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the Lords command to stay in the land of Judah.
Instead Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered.
They also led away all the men women and children and the kings daughters whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.
So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the Lord and went as far as Tahpanhes.
In Tahpanhes the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
While the Jews are watching take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaohs palace in Tahpanhes.
Then say to them This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here he will spread his royal canopy above them.
He will come and attack Egypt bringing death to those destined for death captivity to those destined for captivity and the sword to those destined for the sword.
He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd wraps his garment around him so will he wrap Egypt around himself and depart from there unscathed.
There in the temple of the sun in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt. 
This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egyptin Migdol Tahpanhes and Memphis and in Upper Egypt
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins
because of the evil they have done. They provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew.
Again and again I sent my servants the prophets who said Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!
This is what Jeremiah the prophet told Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah after Baruch had written on a scroll the words Jeremiah was then dictating
This is what the Lord the God of Israel says to you Baruch
You said Woe to me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain I am worn out with groaning and find no rest. 
The Lord said Say this to him This is what the Lord says I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted throughout the land.
Should you then seek great things for yourself? Seek them not. For I will bring disaster on all people declares the Lord but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life. 
This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations
Concerning Egypt This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah
Prepare your shields both large and small and march out for battle!
Harness the horses mount the steeds! Take your positions with helmets on! Polish your spears put on your armor!
What do I see? They are terrified they are retreating their warriors are defeated. They flee in haste without looking back and there is terror on every side declares the Lord.
The swift cannot flee nor the strong escape. In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall.
This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza
This is what the Lord says See how the waters are rising in the north they will become an overflowing torrent. They will overflow the land and everything in it the towns and those who live in them. The people will cry out all who dwell in the land will wail
at the sound of the hoofs of galloping steeds at the noise of enemy chariots and the rumble of their wheels. Fathers will not turn to help their children their hands will hang limp.
For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines and to cut off all survivors who could help Tyre and Sidon. The Lord is about to destroy the Philistines the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
Gaza will shave her head in mourning Ashkelon will be silenced. O remnant on the plain how long will you cut yourselves?
 Ah sword of the Lord you cry how long till you rest? Return to your scabbard cease and be still.
But how can it rest when the Lord has commanded it when he has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the coast?
Concerning Moab This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says Woe to Nebo for it will be ruined. Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured the stronghold will be disgraced and shattered.
Moab will be praised no more in Heshbon men will plot her downfall Come let us put an end to that nation. You too O Madmen will be silenced the sword will pursue you.
Listen to the cries from Horonaim cries of great havoc and destruction.
Moab will be broken her little ones will cry out.
They go up the way to Luhith weeping bitterly as they go on the road down to Horonaim anguished cries over the destruction are heard.
Flee! Run for your lives become like a bush in the desert.
Since you trust in your deeds and riches you too will be taken captive and Chemosh will go into exile together with his priests and officials.
The destroyer will come against every town and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed because the Lord has spoken.
Put salt on Moab for she will be laid waste her towns will become desolate with no one to live in them.
A curse on him who is lax in doing the Lords work! A curse on him who keeps his sword from bloodshed!
Moab has been at rest from youth like wine left on its dregs not poured from one jar to another she has not gone into exile. So she tastes as she did and her aroma is unchanged.
But days are coming declares the Lord when I will send men who pour from jars and they will pour her out they will empty her jars and smash her jugs.
Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.
How can you say We are warriors men valiant in battle?
Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded her finest young men will go down in the slaughter declares the King whose name is the Lord Almighty.
The fall of Moab is at hand her calamity will come quickly.
Mourn for her all who live around her all who know her fame say How broken is the mighty scepter how broken the glorious staff!
Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground O inhabitants of the Daughter of Dibon for he who destroys Moab will come up against you and ruin your fortified cities.
Stand by the road and watch you who live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping ask them What has happened?
Moab is disgraced for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
Judgment has come to the plateau to Holon Jahzah and Mephaath
to Dibon Nebo and Beth Diblathaim
to Kiriathaim Beth Gamul and Beth Meon
to Kerioth and Bozrah to all the towns of Moab far and near.
Moabs horn is cut off her arm is broken declares the Lord.
Make her drunk for she has defied the Lord. Let Moab wallow in her vomit let her be an object of ridicule.
Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? Was she caught among thieves that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her?
Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks you who live in Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the mouth of a cave.
We have heard of Moabs pride her overweening pride and conceit her pride and arrogance and the haughtiness of her heart.
I know her insolence but it is futile declares the Lord and her boasts accomplish nothing.
Therefore I wail over Moab for all Moab I cry out I moan for the men of Kir Hareseth.
I weep for you as Jazer weeps O vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread as far as the sea they reached as far as the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes.
Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts they are not shouts of joy.
The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.
In Moab I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods declares the Lord.
So my heart laments for Moab like a flute it laments like a flute for the men of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone.
Every head is shaved and every beard cut off every hand is slashed and every waist is covered with sackcloth.
On all the roofs in Moab and in the public squares there is nothing but mourning for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants declares the Lord.
Concerning the Ammonites This is what the Lord says Has Israel no sons? Has she no heirs? Why then has Molech taken possession of Gad? Why do his people live in its towns?
But the days are coming declares the Lord when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites it will become a mound of ruins and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. Then Israel will drive out those who drove her out says the Lord.
Wail O Heshbon for Ai is destroyed! Cry out O inhabitants of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn rush here and there inside the walls for Molech will go into exile together with his priests and officials.
Why do you boast of your valleys boast of your valleys so fruitful? O unfaithful daughter you trust in your riches and say Who will attack me?
I will bring terror on you from all those around you declares the Lord the Lord Almighty. Every one of you will be driven away and no one will gather the fugitives.
Yet afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites declares the Lord.
Concerning Edom This is what the Lord Almighty says Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed?
Turn and flee hide in deep caves you who live in Dedan for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time I punish him.
If grape pickers came to you would they not leave a few grapes? If thieves came during the night would they not steal only as much as they wanted?
But I will strip Esau bare I will uncover his hiding places so that he cannot conceal himself. His children relatives and neighbors will perish and he will be no more.
Leave your orphans I will protect their lives. Your widows too can trust in me.
This is what the Lord says If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished but must drink it.
I swear by myself declares the Lord that Bozrah will become a ruin and an object of horror of reproach and of cursing and all its towns will be in ruins forever.
I have heard a message from the Lord An envoy was sent to the nations to say Assemble yourselves to attack it! Rise up for battle!
Now I will make you small among the nations despised among men.
The terror you inspire and the pride of your heart have deceived you you who live in the clefts of the rocks who occupy the heights of the hill. Though you build your nest as high as the eagles from there I will bring you down declares the Lord.
Edom will become an object of horror all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighboring towns says the Lord so no one will live there no man will dwell in it.
Like a lion coming up from Jordans thickets to a rich pastureland I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?
Therefore hear what the Lord has planned against Edom what he has purposed against those who live in Teman The young of the flock will be dragged away he will completely destroy their pasture because of them.
At the sound of their fall the earth will tremble their cry will resound to the Red Sea.
Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edoms warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
Concerning Damascus Hamath and Arpad are dismayed for they have heard bad news. They are disheartened troubled like the restless sea.
Damascus has become feeble she has turned to flee and panic has gripped her anguish and pain have seized her pain like that of a woman in labor.
Why has the city of renown not been abandoned the town in which I delight?
Surely her young men will fall in the streets all her soldiers will be silenced in that day declares the Lord Almighty.
I will set fire to the walls of Damascus it will consume the fortresses of BenHadad.
Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked This is what the Lord says Arise and attack Kedar and destroy the people of the East.
Their tents and their flocks will be taken their shelters will be carried off with all their goods and camels. Men will shout to them Terror on every side!
Flee quickly away! Stay in deep caves you who live in Hazor declares the Lord. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has plotted against you he has devised a plan against you.
Arise and attack a nation at ease which lives in confidence declares the Lord a nation that has neither gates nor bars its people live alone.
Their camels will become plunder and their large herds will be booty. I will scatter to the winds those who are in distant places and will bring disaster on them from every side declares the Lord.
Hazor will become a haunt of jackals a desolate place forever. No one will live there no man will dwell in it.
This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah
This is what the Lord Almighty says See I will break the bow of Elam the mainstay of their might.
I will bring against Elam the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens I will scatter them to the four winds and there will not be a nation where Elams exiles do not go.
I will shatter Elam before their foes before those who seek their lives I will bring disaster upon them even my fierce anger declares the Lord. I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.
I will set my throne in Elam and destroy her king and officials declares the Lord.
Yet I will restore the fortunes of Elam in days to come declares the Lord.
This is the word the Lord spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians
Announce and proclaim among the nations lift up a banner and proclaim it keep nothing back but say Babylon will be captured Bel will be put to shame Marduk filled with terror. Her images will be put to shame and her idols filled with terror.
A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste her land. No one will live in it both men and animals will flee away.
In those days at that time declares the Lord the people of Israel and the people of Judah together will go in tears to seek the Lord their God.
They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They will come and bind themselves to the Lord in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.
My people have been lost sheep their shepherds have led them astray and caused them to roam on the mountains. They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place.
Whoever found them devoured them their enemies said We are not guilty for they sinned against the Lord their true pasture the Lord the hope of their fathers.
Flee out of Babylon leave the land of the Babylonians and be like the goats that lead the flock.
For I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the land of the north. They will take up their positions against her and from the north she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return emptyhanded.
So Babylonia will be plundered all who plunder her will have their fill declares the Lord.
Because you rejoice and are glad you who pillage my inheritance because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain and neigh like stallions
your mother will be greatly ashamed she who gave you birth will be disgraced. She will be the least of the nations a wilderness a dry land a desert.
Because of the Lords anger she will not be inhabited but will be completely desolate. All who pass Babylon will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds.
Take up your positions around Babylon all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows for she has sinned against the Lord.
Shout against her on every side! She surrenders her towers fall her walls are torn down. Since this is the vengeance of the Lord take vengeance on her do to her as she has done to others.
Cut off from Babylon the sower and the reaper with his sickle at harvest. Because of the sword of the oppressor let everyone return to his own people let everyone flee to his own land.
Israel is a scattered flock that lions have chased away. The first to devour him was the king of Assyria the last to crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria.
But I will bring Israel back to his own pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan his appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.
In those days at that time declares the Lord search will be made for Israels guilt but there will be none and for the sins of Judah but none will be found for I will forgive the remnant I spare.
Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue kill and completely destroy them declares the Lord. Do everything I have commanded you.
The noise of battle is in the land the noise of great destruction!
How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! How desolate is Babylon among the nations!
I set a trap for you O Babylon and you were caught before you knew it you were found and captured because you opposed the Lord.
The Lord has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath for the Sovereign Lord Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians.
Come against her from afar. Break open her granaries pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave her no remnant.
Kill all her young bulls let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come the time for them to be punished.
Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the Lord our God has taken vengeance vengeance for his temple.
Summon archers against Babylon all those who draw the bow. Encamp all around her let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds do to her as she has done. For she has defied the Lord the Holy One of Israel.
Therefore her young men will fall in the streets all her soldiers will be silenced in that day declares the Lord.
See I am against you O arrogant one declares the Lord the Lord Almighty for your day has come the time for you to be punished.
The arrogant one will stumble and fall and no one will help her up I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all who are around her.
This is what the Lord Almighty says The people of Israel are oppressed and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast refusing to let them go.
Yet their Redeemer is strong the Lord Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land but unrest to those who live in Babylon.
A sword against the Babylonians! declares the Lord against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men!
A sword against her false prophets! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror.
A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become women. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered.
A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols idols that will go mad with terror.
So desert creatures and hyenas will live there and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns declares the Lord so no one will live there no man will dwell in it.
Look! An army is coming from the north a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.
They are armed with bows and spears they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses they come like men in battle formation to attack you O Daughter of Babylon.
The king of Babylon has heard reports about them and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him pain like that of a woman in labor.
Like a lion coming up from Jordans thickets to a rich pastureland I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?
Therefore hear what the Lord has planned against Babylon what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians The young of the flock will be dragged away he will completely destroy their pasture because of them.
At the sound of Babylons capture the earth will tremble its cry will resound among the nations.
This is what the Lord says See I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai.
I will send foreigners to Babylon to winnow her and to devastate her land they will oppose her on every side in the day of her disaster.
Let not the archer string his bow nor let him put on his armor. Do not spare her young men completely destroy her army.
They will fall down slain in Babylon fatally wounded in her streets.
For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God the Lord Almighty though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel.
Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the Lords vengeance he will pay her what she deserves.
Babylon was a gold cup in the Lords hand she made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine therefore they have now gone mad.
Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Wail over her! Get balm for her pain perhaps she can be healed.
 We would have healed Babylon but she cannot be healed let us leave her and each go to his own land for her judgment reaches to the skies it rises as high as the clouds.
 The Lord has vindicated us come let us tell in Zion what the Lord our God has done.
Sharpen the arrows take up the shields! The Lord has stirred up the kings of the Medes because his purpose is to destroy Babylon. The Lord will take vengeance vengeance for his temple.
Lift up a banner against the walls of Babylon! Reinforce the guard station the watchmen prepare an ambush! The Lord will carry out his purpose his decree against the people of Babylon.
You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures your end has come the time for you to be cut off.
The Lord Almighty has sworn by himself I will surely fill you with men as with a swarm of locusts and they will shout in triumph over you.
He made the earth by his power he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
When he thunders the waters in the heavens roar he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
Every man is senseless and without knowledge every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud they have no breath in them.
They are worthless the objects of mockery when their judgment comes they will perish.
He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these for he is the Maker of all things including the tribe of his inheritance the Lord Almighty is his name.
You are my war club my weapon for battle with you I shatter nations with you I destroy kingdoms
with you I shatter horse and rider with you I shatter chariot and driver
with you I shatter man and woman with you I shatter old man and youth with you I shatter young man and maiden
with you I shatter shepherd and flock with you I shatter farmer and oxen with you I shatter governors and officials.
Before your eyes I will repay Babylon and all who live in Babylonia for all the wrong they have done in Zion declares the Lord.
I am against you O destroying mountain you who destroy the whole earth declares the Lord. I will stretch out my hand against you roll you off the cliffs and make you a burnedout mountain.
No rock will be taken from you for a cornerstone nor any stone for a foundation for you will be desolate forever declares the Lord.
Lift up a banner in the land! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Prepare the nations for battle against her summon against her these kingdoms Ararat Minni and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander against her send up horses like a swarm of locusts.
Prepare the nations for battle against her the kings of the Medes their governors and all their officials and all the countries they rule.
The land trembles and writhes for the Lords purposes against Babylon stand to lay waste the land of Babylon so that no one will live there.
Babylons warriors have stopped fighting they remain in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire the bars of her gates are broken.
One courier follows another and messenger follows messenger to announce to the king of Babylon that his entire city is captured
the river crossings seized the marshes set on fire and the soldiers terrified.
This is what the Lord Almighty the God of Israel says The Daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled the time to harvest her will soon come.
Zedekiah was twentyone years old when he became king and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mothers name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah she was from Libnah.
He did evil in the eyes of the Lord just as Jehoiakim had done.
It was because of the Lords anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
So in the ninth year of Zedekiahs reign on the tenth day of the tenth month Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They camped outside the city and built siege works all around it.
The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.
Then the city wall was broken through and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the kings garden though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah
but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered
and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath where he pronounced sentence on him.
There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes he also killed all the officials of Judah.
Then he put out Zedekiahs eyes bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon where he put him in prison till the day of his death.
On the tenth day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard who served the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem.
He set fire to the temple of the Lord the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.
The whole Babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city along with the rest of the craftsmen and those who had gone over to the king of Babylon.
But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the Lord and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.
They also took away the pots shovels wick trimmers sprinkling bowls dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.
The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins censers sprinkling bowls pots lampstands dishes and bowls used for drink offeringsall that were made of pure gold or silver.
The bronze from the two pillars the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it and the movable stands which King Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord was more than could be weighed.
Each of the pillars was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference each was four fingers thick and hollow.
How deserted lies the city once so full of people! How like a widow is she who once was great among the nations! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave.
Bitterly she weeps at night tears are upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is none to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her they have become her enemies.
After affliction and harsh labor Judah has gone into exile. She dwells among the nations she finds no resting place. All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
The roads to Zion mourn for no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gateways are desolate her priests groan her maidens grieve and she is in bitter anguish.
Her foes have become her masters her enemies are at ease. The Lord has brought her grief because of her many sins. Her children have gone into exile captive before the foe.
All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture in weakness they have fled before the pursuer.
In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction.
Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean. All who honored her despise her for they have seen her nakedness she herself groans and turns away.
Her filthiness clung to her skirts she did not consider her future. Her fall was astounding there was none to comfort her. Look O Lord on my affliction for the enemy has triumphed.
The enemy laid hands on all her treasures she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary those you had forbidden to enter your assembly.
All her people groan as they search for bread they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. Look O Lord and consider for I am despised.
Is it nothing to you all you who pass by? Look around and see. Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me that the Lord brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?
From on high he sent fire sent it down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate faint all the day long.
My sins have been bound into a yoke by his hands they were woven together. They have come upon my neck and the Lord has sapped my strength. He has handed me over to those I cannot withstand.
The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men. In his winepress the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah.
This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.
Zion stretches out her hands but there is no one to comfort her. The Lord has decreed for Jacob that his neighbors become his foes Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
The Lord is righteous yet I rebelled against his command. Listen all you peoples look upon my suffering. My young men and maidens have gone into exile.
I called to my allies but they betrayed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
See O Lord how distressed I am! I am in torment within and in my heart I am disturbed for I have been most rebellious. Outside the sword bereaves inside there is only death.
People have heard my groaning but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my distress they rejoice at what you have done. May you bring the day you have announced so they may become like me.
Let all their wickedness come before you deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins. My groans are many and my heart is faint.
How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with the cloud of his anger! He has hurled down the splendor of Israel from heaven to earth he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the Daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.
In fierce anger he has cut off every horn of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.
Like an enemy he has strung his bow his right hand is ready. Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.
The Lord is like an enemy he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.
He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden he has destroyed his place of meeting. The Lord has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and her Sabbaths in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest.
The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary. He has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces they have raised a shout in the house of the Lord as on the day of an appointed feast.
The Lord determined to tear down the wall around the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying. He made ramparts and walls lament together they wasted away.
Her gates have sunk into the ground their bars he has broken and destroyed. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations the law is no more and her prophets no longer find visions from the Lord.
The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
My eyes fail from weeping I am in torment within my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.
They say to their mothers Where is bread and wine? as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city as their lives ebb away in their mothers arms.
What can I say for you? With what can I compare you O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you that I may comfort you O Virgin Daughter of Zion? Your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?
The visions of your prophets were false and worthless they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. The oracles they gave you were false and misleading.
All who pass your way clap their hands at you they scoff and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth?
All your enemies open their mouths wide against you they scoff and gnash their teeth and say We have swallowed her up. This is the day we have waited for we have lived to see it.
The Lord has done what he planned he has fulfilled his word which he decreed long ago. He has overthrown you without pity he has let the enemy gloat over you he has exalted the horn of your foes.
The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion let your tears flow like a river day and night give yourself no relief your eyes no rest.
Arise cry out in the night as the watches of the night begin pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children who faint from hunger at the head of every street.
Look O Lord and consider Whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring the children they have cared for? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of your anger you have slaughtered them without pity.
As you summon to a feast day so you summoned against me terrors on every side. In the day of the Lords anger no one escaped or survived those I cared for and reared my enemy has destroyed.
I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light
indeed he has turned his hand against me again and again all day long.
He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones.
He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.
He has walled me in so I cannot escape he has weighed me down with chains.
Even when I call out or cry for help he shuts out my prayer.
He has barred my way with blocks of stone he has made my paths crooked.
Like a bear lying in wait like a lion in hiding
he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help.
He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows.
He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver.
I became the laughingstock of all my people they mock me in song all day long.
He has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall.
He has broken my teeth with gravel he has trampled me in the dust.
I have been deprived of peace I have forgotten what prosperity is.
So I say My splendor is gone and all that I had hoped from the Lord.
I remember my affliction and my wandering the bitterness and the gall.
I well remember them and my soul is downcast within me.
Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope
How the gold has lost its luster the fine gold become dull! The sacred gems are scattered at the head of every street.
How the precious sons of Zion once worth their weight in gold are now considered as pots of clay the work of a potters hands!
Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert.
Because of thirst the infants tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth the children beg for bread but no one gives it to them.
Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets. Those nurtured in purple now lie on ash heaps.
The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her.
Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk their bodies more ruddy than rubies their appearance like sapphires.
But now they are blacker than soot they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones it has become as dry as a stick.
Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine racked with hunger they waste away for lack of food from the field.
With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children who became their food when my people were destroyed.
The Lord has given full vent to his wrath he has poured out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations.
The kings of the earth did not believe nor did any of the worlds people that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests who shed within her the blood of the righteous.
Now they grope through the streets like men who are blind. They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments.
Go away! You are unclean! men cry to them. Away! Away! Dont touch us! When they flee and wander about people among the nations say They can stay here no longer.
The Lord himself has scattered them he no longer watches over them. The priests are shown no honor the elders no favor.
Moreover our eyes failed looking in vain for help from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us.
Men stalked us at every step so we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near our days were numbered for our end had come.
Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert.
The Lords anointed our very life breath was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.
Rejoice and be glad O Daughter of Edom you who live in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed you will be drunk and stripped naked.
O Daughter of Zion your punishment will end he will not prolong your exile. But O Daughter of Edom he will punish your sin and expose your wickedness.
Remember O Lord what has happened to us look and see our disgrace.
Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens our homes to foreigners.
We have become orphans and fatherless our mothers like widows.
We must buy the water we drink our wood can be had only at a price.
Those who pursue us are at our heels we are weary and find no rest.
We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.
Our fathers sinned and are no more and we bear their punishment.
Slaves rule over us and there is none to free us from their hands.
We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert.
Our skin is hot as an oven feverish from hunger.
Women have been ravished in Zion and virgins in the towns of Judah.
Princes have been hung up by their hands elders are shown no respect.
Young men toil at the millstones boys stagger under loads of wood.
The elders are gone from the city gate the young men have stopped their music.
Joy is gone from our hearts our dancing has turned to mourning.
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us for we have sinned!
Because of this our hearts are faint because of these things our eyes grow dim
for Mount Zion which lies desolate with jackals prowling over it.
You O Lord reign forever your throne endures from generation to generation.
Why do you always forget us? Why do you forsake us so long?
Restore us to yourself O Lord that we may return renew our days as of old
unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.
In the thirtieth year in the fourth month on the fifth day while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
On the fifth of the monthit was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin
the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest the son of Buzi by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians. There the hand of the Lord was upon him.
I looked and I saw a windstorm coming out of the northan immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal
and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man
but each of them had four faces and four wings.
Their legs were straight their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.
Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings
and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead they did not turn as they moved.
He said to me Son of man stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.
As he spoke the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet and I heard him speaking to me.
He said Son of man I am sending you to the Israelites to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me they and their fathers have been in revolt against me to this very day.
The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says.
And whether they listen or fail to listenfor they are a rebellious housethey will know that a prophet has been among them.
And you son of man do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or terrified by them though they are a rebellious house.
You must speak my words to them whether they listen or fail to listen for they are rebellious.
But you son of man listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious house open your mouth and eat what I give you.
Then I looked and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll
which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe.
And he said to me Son of man eat what is before you eat this scroll then go and speak to the house of Israel.
So I opened my mouth and he gave me the scroll to eat.
Then he said to me Son of man eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it. So I ate it and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.
He then said to me Son of man go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them.
You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language but to the house of Israel
not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them they would have listened to you.
But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me for the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate.
But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.
I will make your forehead like the hardest stone harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them though they are a rebellious house.
And he said to me Son of man listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you.
Go now to your countrymen in exile and speak to them. Say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says whether they listen or fail to listen.
Then the Spirit lifted me up and I heard behind me a loud rumbling soundMay the glory of the Lord be praised in his dwelling place!
the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them a loud rumbling sound.
The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit with the strong hand of the Lord upon me.
I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there where they were living I sat among them for seven daysoverwhelmed.
At the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me
Now son of man take a clay tablet put it in front of you and draw the city of Jerusalem on it.
Then lay siege to it Erect siege works against it build a ramp up to it set up camps against it and put battering rams around it.
Then take an iron pan place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it. It will be under siege and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side.
I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for 390 days you will bear the sin of the house of Israel.
After you have finished this lie down again this time on your right side and bear the sin of the house of Judah. I have assigned you 40 days a day for each year.
Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her.
I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.
Take wheat and barley beans and lentils millet and spelt put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side.
Weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day and eat it at set times.
Also measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at set times.
Eat the food as you would a barley cake bake it in the sight of the people using human excrement for fuel.
The Lord said In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them.
Then I said Not so Sovereign Lord! I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals. No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth.
Very well he said I will let you bake your bread over cow manure instead of human excrement.
He then said to me Son of man I will cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem. The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair
for food and water will be scarce. They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of their sin.
Now son of man take a sharp sword and use it as a barbers razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair.
When the days of your siege come to an end burn a third of the hair with fire inside the city. Take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city. And scatter a third to the wind. For I will pursue them with drawn sword.
But take a few strands of hair and tuck them away in the folds of your garment.
Again take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up. A fire will spread from there to the whole house of Israel.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says This is Jerusalem which I have set in the center of the nations with countries all around her.
Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her. She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says You have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws. You have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I myself am against you Jerusalem and I will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations.
Because of all your detestable idols I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again.
Therefore in your midst fathers will eat their children and children will eat their fathers. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds.
Therefore as surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices I myself will withdraw my favor I will not look on you with pity or spare you.
A third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you a third will fall by the sword outside your walls and a third I will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword.
Then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside and I will be avenged. And when I have spent my wrath upon them they will know that I the Lord have spoken in my zeal.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man set your face against the mountains of Israel prophesy against them
and say O mountains of Israel hear the word of the Sovereign Lord. This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys I am about to bring a sword against you and I will destroy your high places.
Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed and I will slay your people in front of your idols.
I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
Wherever you live the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated your idols smashed and ruined your incense altars broken down and what you have made wiped out.
Your people will fall slain among you and you will know that I am the Lord.
 But I will spare some for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations.
Then in the nations where they have been carried captive those who escape will remember mehow I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts which have turned away from me and by their eyes which have lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices.
And they will know that I am the Lord I did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity on them.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says Strike your hands together and stamp your feet and cry out Alas! because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the house of Israel for they will fall by the sword famine and plague.
He that is far away will die of the plague and he that is near will fall by the sword and he that survives and is spared will die of famine. So will I spend my wrath upon them.
And they will know that I am the Lord when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars on every high hill and on all the mountaintops under every spreading tree and every leafy oakplaces where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols.
And I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to Diblah wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the Lord. 
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man this is what the Sovereign Lord says to the land of Israel The end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
The end is now upon you and I will unleash my anger against you. I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.
I will not look on you with pity or spare you I will surely repay you for your conduct and the detestable practices among you. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says Disaster! An unheardof disaster is coming.
The end has come! The end has come! It has roused itself against you. It has come!
Doom has come upon youyou who dwell in the land. The time has come the day is near there is panic not joy upon the mountains.
I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.
I will not look on you with pity or spare you I will repay you in accordance with your conduct and the detestable practices among you. Then you will know that it is I the Lord who strikes the blow.
The day is here! It has come! Doom has burst forth the rod has budded arrogance has blossomed!
Violence has grown into a rod to punish wickedness none of the people will be left none of that crowdno wealth nothing of value.
The time has come the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller grieve for wrath is upon the whole crowd.
The seller will not recover the land he has sold as long as both of them live for the vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed. Because of their sins not one of them will preserve his life.
Though they blow the trumpet and get everything ready no one will go into battle for my wrath is upon the whole crowd.
Outside is the sword inside are plague and famine those in the country will die by the sword and those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.
All who survive and escape will be in the mountains moaning like doves of the valleys each because of his sins.
Every hand will go limp and every knee will become as weak as water.
In the sixth year in the sixth month on the fifth day while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me the hand of the Sovereign Lord came upon me there.
I looked and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.
He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem to the entrance to the north gate of the inner court where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood.
And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel as in the vision I had seen in the plain.
Then he said to me Son of man look toward the north. So I looked and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.
And he said to me Son of man do you see what they are doingthe utterly detestable things the house of Israel is doing here things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.
Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked and I saw a hole in the wall.
He said to me Son of man now dig into the wall. So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.
And he said to me Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.
So I went in and looked and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and detestable animals and all the idols of the house of Israel.
Then I heard him call out in a loud voice Bring the guards of the city here each with a weapon in his hand.
And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate which faces north each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.
Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim where it had been and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the Lord called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side
and said to him Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.
As I listened he said to the others Follow him through the city and kill without showing pity or compassion.
Slaughter old men young men and maidens women and children but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary. So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple.
Then he said to them Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go! So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
While they were killing and I was left alone I fell facedown crying out Ah Sovereign Lord! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?
He answered me The sin of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say The Lord has forsaken the land the Lord does not see.
So I will not look on them with pity or spare them but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.
Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word saying I have done as you commanded.
I looked and I saw the likeness of a throne of sapphire above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim.
The Lord said to the man clothed in linen Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city. And as I watched he went in.
Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in and a cloud filled the inner court.
Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple. The cloud filled the temple and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the Lord.
The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
When the Lord commanded the man in linen Take fire from among the wheels from among the cherubim the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen who took it and went out.

I looked and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels one beside each of the cherubim the wheels sparkled like chrysolite.
As for their appearance the four of them looked alike each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel.
As they moved they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced the wheels did not turn about as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced without turning as they went.
Their entire bodies including their backs their hands and their wings were completely full of eyes as were their four wheels.
I heard the wheels being called the whirling wheels.
Each of the cherubim had four faces One face was that of a cherub the second the face of a man the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle.
Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River.
When the cherubim moved the wheels beside them moved and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground the wheels did not leave their side.
When the cherubim stood still they also stood still and when the cherubim rose they rose with them because the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
Then the glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim.
While I watched the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground and as they went the wheels went with them. They stopped at the entrance to the east gate of the Lords house and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the Kebar River and I realized that they were cherubim.
Each had four faces and four wings and under their wings was what looked like the hands of a man.
Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the Kebar River. Each one went straight ahead.
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the Lord that faces east. There at the entrance to the gate were twentyfive men and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah leaders of the people.
The Lord said to me Son of man these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city.
They say Will it not soon be time to build houses? This city is a cooking pot and we are the meat.
Therefore prophesy against them prophesy son of man.
Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon me and he told me to say This is what the Lord says That is what you are saying O house of Israel but I know what is going through your mind.
You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says The bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot but I will drive you out of it.
You fear the sword and the sword is what I will bring against you declares the Sovereign Lord.
I will drive you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners and inflict punishment on you.
You will fall by the sword and I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
This city will not be a pot for you nor will you be the meat in it I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel.
And you will know that I am the Lord for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you.
Now as I was prophesying Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice Ah Sovereign Lord! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man your brothersyour brothers who are your blood relatives and the whole house of Israelare those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said They are far away from the Lord this land was given to us as our possession.
Therefore say This is what the Sovereign Lord says Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.
Therefore say This is what the Sovereign Lord says I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered and I will give you back the land of Israel again.
They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols.
I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.
Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people and I will be their God.
But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols I will bring down on their own heads what they have done declares the Sovereign Lord.
Then the cherubim with the wheels beside them spread their wings and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it.
The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen went up from me
and I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear for they are a rebellious people.
Therefore son of man pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime as they watch set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house.
During the daytime while they watch bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening while they are watching go out like those who go into exile.
While they watch dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it.
Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.
So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk carrying them on my shoulders while they watched.
In the morning the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man did not that rebellious house of Israel ask you What are you doing?
Say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and the whole house of Israel who are there.
Say to them I am a sign to you. As I have done so it will be done to them. They will go into exile as captives.
The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land.
I will spread my net for him and he will be caught in my snare I will bring him to Babylonia the land of the Chaldeans but he will not see it and there he will die.
I will scatter to the winds all those around himhis staff and all his troopsand I will pursue them with drawn sword.
They will know that I am the Lord when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries.
But I will spare a few of them from the sword famine and plague so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man tremble as you eat your food and shudder in fear as you drink your water.
Say to the people of the land This is what the Sovereign Lord says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there.
The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel The days go by and every vision comes to nothing?
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination Hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the Sovereign Lord says Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
Your prophets O Israel are like jackals among ruins.
You have not gone up to the breaks in the wall to repair it for the house of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the Lord.
Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. They say The Lord declares when the Lord has not sent them yet they expect their words to be fulfilled.
Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say The Lord declares though I have not spoken?
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says Because of your false words and lying visions I am against you declares the Sovereign Lord.
My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of the house of Israel nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.
 Because they lead my people astray saying Peace when there is no peace and because when a flimsy wall is built they cover it with whitewash
therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall. Rain will come in torrents and I will send hailstones hurtling down and violent winds will burst forth.
When the wall collapses will people not ask you Where is the whitewash you covered it with?
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says In my wrath I will unleash a violent wind and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury.
I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls you will be destroyed in it and you will know that I am the Lord.
So I will spend my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. I will say to you The wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it
those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her when there was no peace declares the Sovereign Lord. 
Now son of man set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them
and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own?
You have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to my people who listen to lies you have killed those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live.
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds and I will tear them from your arms I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds.
I will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands and they will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Because you disheartened the righteous with your lies when I had brought them no grief and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and so save their lives
therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will save my people from your hands. And then you will know that I am the Lord. 
Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down in front of me.
Then the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all?
Therefore speak to them and tell them This is what the Sovereign Lord says When any Israelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face and then goes to a prophet I the Lord will answer him myself in keeping with his great idolatry.
I will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of Israel who have all deserted me for their idols.
Therefore say to the house of Israel This is what the Sovereign Lord says Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!
 When any Israelite or any alien living in Israel separates himself from me and sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face and then goes to a prophet to inquire of me I the Lord will answer him myself.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man how is the wood of a vine better than that of a branch on any of the trees in the forest?
Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on?
And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle is it then useful for anything?
If it was not useful for anything when it was whole how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem.
I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them you will know that I am the Lord.
I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful declares the Sovereign Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices
and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Jerusalem Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
On the day you were born your cord was not cut nor were you washed with water to make you clean nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths.
No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather you were thrown out into the open field for on the day you were born you were despised.
 Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood and as you lay there in your blood I said to you Live!
I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew you who were naked and bare.
 Later I passed by and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you declares the Sovereign Lord and you became mine.
 I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you.
I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments.
I adorned you with jewelry I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck
and I put a ring on your nose earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
So you were adorned with gold and silver your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was fine flour honey and olive oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen.
And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect declares the Sovereign Lord.
 But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his.
You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places where you carried on your prostitution. Such things should not happen nor should they ever occur.
You also took the fine jewelry I gave you the jewelry made of my gold and silver and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them.
And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them and you offered my oil and incense before them.
Also the food I provided for youthe fine flour olive oil and honey I gave you to eatyou offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened declares the Sovereign Lord.
 And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough?
You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols.
In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth when you were naked and bare kicking about in your blood.
 Woe! Woe to you declares the Sovereign Lord. In addition to all your other wickedness
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man set forth an allegory and tell the house of Israel a parable.
Say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says A great eagle with powerful wings long feathers and full plumage of varied colors came to Lebanon. Taking hold of the top of a cedar
he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants where he planted it in a city of traders.
 He took some of the seed of your land and put it in fertile soil. He planted it like a willow by abundant water
and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine. Its branches turned toward him but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs.
 But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage. The vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water.
It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches bear fruit and become a splendid vine.
Say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots.
Even if it is transplanted will it thrive? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes itwither away in the plot where it grew? 
Then the word of the Lord came to me
Say to this rebellious house Do you not know what these things mean? Say to them The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles bringing them back with him to Babylon.
Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land
so that the kingdom would be brought low unable to rise again surviving only by keeping his treaty.
But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape?
 As surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord he shall die in Babylon in the land of the king who put him on the throne whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke.
Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives.
He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things he shall not escape.
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says As surely as I live I will bring down on his head my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke.
I will spread my net for him and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment upon him there because he was unfaithful to me.
All his fleeing troops will fall by the sword and the survivors will be scattered to the winds. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it it will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it they will find shelter in the shade of its branches.
All the trees of the field will know that I the Lord bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish.  I the Lord have spoken and I will do it. 
The word of the Lord came to me
What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel  The fathers eat sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge?
As surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel.
For every living soul belongs to me the father as well as the sonboth alike belong to me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.
Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right.
He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbors wife or lie with a woman during her period.
He does not oppress anyone but returns what he took in pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked.
He does not lend at usury or take excessive interest. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between man and man.
He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous he will surely live declares the Sovereign Lord.
Suppose he has a violent son who sheds blood or does any of these other things
 He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbors wife.
He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things.
He lends at usury and takes excessive interest. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things he will surely be put to death and his blood will be on his own head.
Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel
and say  What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.
She brought up one of her cubs and he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.
The nations heard about him and he was trapped in their pit. They led him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
 When she saw her hope unfulfilled her expectation gone she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion.
He prowled among the lions for he was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the prey and he devoured men.
He broke down their strongholds and devastated their towns. The land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring.
Then the nations came against him those from regions round about. They spread their net for him and he was trapped in their pit.
With hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him in prison so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel.
 Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the water it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water.
Its branches were strong fit for a rulers scepter. It towered high above the thick foliage conspicuous for its height and for its many branches.
But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind made it shrivel it was stripped of its fruit its strong branches withered and fire consumed them.
Now it is planted in the desert in a dry and thirsty land.
Fire spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit. No strong branch is left on it fit for a rulers scepter. This is a lament and is to be used as a lament.
In the seventh year in the fifth month on the tenth day some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord and they sat down in front of me.
Then the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man speak to the elders of Israel and say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live I will not let you inquire of me declares the Sovereign Lord.
Will you judge them? Will you judge them son of man? Then confront them with the detestable practices of their fathers
and say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says On the day I chose Israel I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of the house of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them I am the Lord your God.
On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them a land flowing with milk and honey the most beautiful of all lands.
And I said to them Each of you get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
 But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt.
But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations they lived among and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites by bringing them out of Egypt.
Therefore I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the desert.
I gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws for the man who obeys them will live by them.
Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us so they would know that I the Lord made them holy.
 Yet the people of Israel rebelled against me in the desert. They did not follow my decrees but rejected my lawsalthough the man who obeys them will live by themand they utterly desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the desert.
But for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the desert that I would not bring them into the land I had given thema land flowing with milk and honey most beautiful of all lands
because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols.
Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the desert.
I said to their children in the desert Do not follow the statutes of your fathers or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols.
I am the Lord your God follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
Keep my Sabbaths holy that they may be a sign between us. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.
 But the children rebelled against me They did not follow my decrees they were not careful to keep my lawsalthough the man who obeys them will live by themand they desecrated my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the desert.
But I withheld my hand and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the desert that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries
because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths and their eyes lusted after their fathers idols.
I also gave them over to statutes that were not good and laws they could not live by
I let them become defiled through their giftsthe sacrifice of every firstborn that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the Lord.
Therefore son of man speak to the people of Israel and say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says In this also your fathers blasphemed me by forsaking me
When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree there they offered their sacrifices made offerings that provoked me to anger presented their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings.
Then I said to them What is this high place you go to? 
Therefore say to the house of Israel This is what the Sovereign Lord says Will you defile yourselves the way your fathers did and lust after their vile images?
When you offer your giftsthe sacrifice of your sons in the fireyou continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Am I to let you inquire of me O house of Israel? As surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord I will not let you inquire of me.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man set your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuary. Prophesy against the land of Israel
and say to her This is what the Lord says I am against you. I will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
Because I am going to cut off the righteous and the wicked my sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.
Then all people will know that I the Lord have drawn my sword from its scabbard it will not return again.
Therefore groan son of man! Groan before them with broken heart and bitter grief.
And when they ask you Why are you groaning? you shall say Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt and every hand go limp every spirit will become faint and every knee become as weak as water. It is coming! It will surely take place declares the Sovereign Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man prophesy and say This is what the Lord says  A sword a sword sharpened and polished
sharpened for the slaughter polished to flash like lightning!  Shall we rejoice in the scepter of my son Judah? The sword despises every such stick.
 The sword is appointed to be polished to be grasped with the hand it is sharpened and polished made ready for the hand of the slayer.
Cry out and wail son of man for it is against my people it is against all the princes of Israel. They are thrown to the sword along with my people. Therefore beat your breast.
 Testing will surely come. And what if the scepter of Judah which the sword despises does not continue? declares the Sovereign Lord.
So then son of man prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike twice even three times. It is a sword for slaughter a sword for great slaughter closing in on them from every side.
So that hearts may melt and the fallen be many I have stationed the sword for slaughter at all their gates. Oh! It is made to flash like lightning it is grasped for slaughter.
O sword slash to the right then to the left wherever your blade is turned.
I too will strike my hands together and my wrath will subside. I the Lord have spoken.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take both starting from the same country. Make a signpost where the road branches off to the city.
Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites and another against Judah and fortified Jerusalem.
For the king of Babylon will stop at the fork in the road at the junction of the two roads to seek an omen He will cast lots with arrows he will consult his idols he will examine the liver.
Into his right hand will come the lot for Jerusalem where he is to set up battering rams to give the command to slaughter to sound the battle cry to set battering rams against the gates to build a ramp and to erect siege works.
It will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him but he will remind them of their guilt and take them captive.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says Because you people have brought to mind your guilt by your open rebellion revealing your sins in all that you dobecause you have done this you will be taken captive.
 O profane and wicked prince of Israel whose day has come whose time of punishment has reached its climax
this is what the Sovereign Lord says Take off the turban remove the crown. It will not be as it was The lowly will be exalted and the exalted will be brought low.
A ruin! A ruin! I will make it a ruin! It will not be restored until he comes to whom it rightfully belongs to him I will give it.
And you son of man prophesy and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says about the Ammonites and their insults  A sword a sword drawn for the slaughter polished to consume and to flash like lightning!
Despite false visions concerning you and lying divinations about you it will be laid on the necks of the wicked who are to be slain whose day has come whose time of punishment has reached its climax.
Return the sword to its scabbard. In the place where you were created in the land of your ancestry I will judge you.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man will you judge her? Will you judge this city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her detestable practices
and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says O city that brings on herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself by making idols
you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close and the end of your years has come. Therefore I will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries.
Those who are near and those who are far away will mock you O infamous city full of turmoil.
 See how each of the princes of Israel who are in you uses his power to shed blood.
In you they have treated father and mother with contempt in you they have oppressed the alien and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.
You have despised my holy things and desecrated my Sabbaths.
In you are slanderous men bent on shedding blood in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts.
In you are those who dishonor their fathers bed in you are those who violate women during their period when they are ceremonially unclean.
In you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbors wife another shamefully defiles his daughterinlaw and another violates his sister his own fathers daughter.
In you men accept bribes to shed blood you take usury and excessive interest and make unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion. And you have forgotten me declares the Sovereign Lord.
 I will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst.
Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the Lord have spoken and I will do it.
I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries and I will put an end to your uncleanness.
When you have been defiled in the eyes of the nations you will know that I am the Lord. 
Then the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man the house of Israel has become dross to me all of them are the copper tin iron and lead left inside a furnace. They are but the dross of silver.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says Because you have all become dross I will gather you into Jerusalem.
As men gather silver copper iron lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with a fiery blast so will I gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you.
I will gather you and I will blow on you with my fiery wrath and you will be melted inside her.
As silver is melted in a furnace so you will be melted inside her and you will know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath upon you. 
Again the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man say to the land You are a land that has had no rain or showers in the day of wrath.
There is a conspiracy of her princes within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey they devour people take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her.
Her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things they do not distinguish between the holy and the common they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths so that I am profaned among them.
Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.
Her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations. They say This is what the Sovereign Lord sayswhen the Lord has not spoken.
The people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the alien denying them justice.
I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it but I found none.
So I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger bringing down on their own heads all they have done declares the Sovereign Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man there were two women daughters of the same mother.
They became prostitutes in Egypt engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed.
The older was named Oholah and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine and she lusted after her lovers the Assyrianswarriors
clothed in blue governors and commanders all of them handsome young men and mounted horsemen.
She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after.
She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt when during her youth men slept with her caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.
Therefore I handed her over to her lovers the Assyrians for whom she lusted.
They stripped her naked took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women and punishment was inflicted on her.
Her sister Oholibah saw this yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister.
She too lusted after the Assyriansgovernors and commanders warriors in full dress mounted horsemen all handsome young men.
I saw that she too defiled herself both of them went the same way.
But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red
with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers natives of Chaldea.
As soon as she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
Then the Babylonians came to her to the bed of love and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them she turned away from them in disgust.
When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness I turned away from her in disgust just as I had turned away from her sister.
Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth when she was a prostitute in Egypt.
There she lusted after her lovers whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.
So you longed for the lewdness of your youth when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.
Therefore Oholibah this is what the Sovereign Lord says I will stir up your lovers against you those you turned away from in disgust and I will bring them against you from every side
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa and all the Assyrians with them handsome young men all of them governors and commanders chariot officers and men of high rank all mounted on horses.
They will come against you with weapons chariots and wagons and with a throng of people they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment and they will punish you according to their standards.
I will direct my jealous anger against you and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire.
They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry.
In the ninth year in the tenth month on the tenth day the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man record this date this very date because the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
Tell this rebellious house a parable and say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says  Put on the cooking pot put it on and pour water into it.
Put into it the pieces of meat all the choice piecesthe leg and the shoulder. Fill it with the best of these bones
take the pick of the flock. Pile wood beneath it for the bones bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.
 For this is what the Sovereign Lord says  Woe to the city of bloodshed to the pot now encrusted whose deposit will not go away! Empty it piece by piece without casting lots for them.
 For the blood she shed is in her midst She poured it on the bare rock she did not pour it on the ground where the dust would cover it.
To stir up wrath and take revenge I put her blood on the bare rock so that it would not be covered.
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says  Woe to the city of bloodshed! I too will pile the wood high.
So heap on the wood and kindle the fire. Cook the meat well mixing in the spices and let the bones be charred.
Then set the empty pot on the coals till it becomes hot and its copper glows so its impurities may be melted and its deposit burned away.
It has frustrated all efforts its heavy deposit has not been removed not even by fire.
 Now your impurity is lewdness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided.
 I the Lord have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back I will not have pity nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your conduct and your actions declares the Sovereign Lord. 
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes. Yet do not lament or weep or shed any tears.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
Say to them Hear the word of the Sovereign Lord. This is what the Sovereign Lord says Because you said Aha! over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile
therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels and Ammon into a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
For this is what the Sovereign Lord says Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel
therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the nations and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you and you will know that I am the Lord. 
This is what the Sovereign Lord says Because Moab and Seir said Look the house of Judah has become like all the other nations
therefore I will expose the flank of Moab beginning at its frontier townsBeth Jeshimoth Baal Meon and Kiriathaimthe glory of that land.
I will give Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations
and I will inflict punishment on Moab. Then they will know that I am the Lord. 
This is what the Sovereign Lord says Because Edom took revenge on the house of Judah and became very guilty by doing so
therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I will stretch out my hand against Edom and kill its men and their animals. I will lay it waste and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword.
I will take vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel and they will deal with Edom in accordance with my anger and my wrath they will know my vengeance declares the Sovereign Lord. 
This is what the Sovereign Lord says Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with malice in their hearts and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah
therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines and I will cut off the Kerethites and destroy those remaining along the coast.
I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the Lord when I take vengeance on them. 
In the eleventh year on the first day of the month the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man because Tyre has said of Jerusalem Aha! The gate to the nations is broken and its doors have swung open to me now that she lies in ruins I will prosper
therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I am against you O Tyre and I will bring many nations against you like the sea casting up its waves.
They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock.
Out in the sea she will become a place to spread fishnets for I have spoken declares the Sovereign Lord. She will become plunder for the nations
and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
For this is what the Sovereign Lord says From the north I am going to bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon king of kings with horses and chariots with horsemen and a great army.
He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword he will set up siege works against you build a ramp up to your walls and raise his shields against you.
He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons.
His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust. Your walls will tremble at the noise of the war horses wagons and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been broken through.
The hoofs of his horses will trample all your streets he will kill your people with the sword and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.
They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones timber and rubble into the sea.
I will put an end to your noisy songs and the music of your harps will be heard no more.
I will make you a bare rock and you will become a place to spread fishnets. You will never be rebuilt for I the Lord have spoken declares the Sovereign Lord.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Tyre Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place in you?
Then all the princes of the coast will step down from their thrones and lay aside their robes and take off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror they will sit on the ground trembling every moment appalled at you.
Then they will take up a lament concerning you and say to you  How you are destroyed O city of renown peopled by men of the sea! You were a power on the seas you and your citizens you put your terror on all who lived there.
Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your fall the islands in the sea are terrified at your collapse.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says When I make you a desolate city like cities no longer inhabited and when I bring the ocean depths over you and its vast waters cover you
then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit to the people of long ago. I will make you dwell in the earth below as in ancient ruins with those who go down to the pit and you will not return or take your place in the land of the living.
I will bring you to a horrible end and you will be no more. You will be sought but you will never again be found declares the Sovereign Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man take up a lament concerning Tyre.
Say to Tyre situated at the gateway to the sea merchant of peoples on many coasts This is what the Sovereign Lord says  You say O Tyre I am perfect in beauty.

The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man say to the ruler of Tyre This is what the Sovereign Lord says  In the pride of your heart you say I am a god I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas. But you are a man and not a god though you think you are as wise as a god.
Are you wiser than Daniel? Is no secret hidden from you?
By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries.
By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud.
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says  Because you think you are wise as wise as a god
I am going to bring foreigners against you the most ruthless of nations they will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and pierce your shining splendor.
They will bring you down to the pit and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
Will you then say I am a god in the presence of those who kill you? You will be but a man not a god in the hands of those who slay you.
You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. I have spoken declares the Sovereign Lord. 
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him This is what the Sovereign Lord says  You were the model of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
You were in Eden the garden of God every precious stone adorned you ruby topaz and emerald chrysolite onyx and jasper sapphire turquoise and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold on the day you were created they were prepared.
You were anointed as a guardian cherub for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God you walked among the fiery stones.
You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you.
Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God and I expelled you O guardian cherub from among the fiery stones.
Your heart became proud on account of your beauty and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth I made a spectacle of you before kings.
By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you and it consumed you and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.
All the nations who knew you are appalled at you you have come to a horrible end and will be no more. 
The word of the Lord came to me
In the tenth year in the tenth month on the twelfth day the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
Speak to him and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says  I am against you Pharaoh king of Egypt you great monster lying among your streams. You say The Nile is mine I made it for myself.
But I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will pull you out from among your streams with all the fish sticking to your scales.
I will leave you in the desert you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field and not be gathered or picked up. I will give you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air.
Then all who live in Egypt will know that I am the Lord.  You have been a staff of reed for the house of Israel.
When they grasped you with their hands you splintered and you tore open their shoulders when they leaned on you you broke and their backs were wrenched.
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I will bring a sword against you and kill your men and their animals.
Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the Lord.  Because you said The Nile is mine I made it
therefore I am against you and against your streams and I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Aswan as far as the border of Cush.
No foot of man or animal will pass through it no one will live there for forty years.
I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands and her cities will lie desolate forty years among ruined cities. And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries.
 Yet this is what the Sovereign Lord says At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations where they were scattered.
I will bring them back from captivity and return them to Upper Egypt the land of their ancestry. There they will be a lowly kingdom.
It will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations.
Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of Israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord. 
In the twentyseventh year in the first month on the first day the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon drove his army in a hard campaign against Tyre every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw. Yet he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as pay for his army.
I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army did it for me declares the Sovereign Lord.
On that day I will make a horn grow for the house of Israel and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man prophesy and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says  Wail and say Alas for that day!
For the day is near the day of the Lord is near a day of clouds a time of doom for the nations.
A sword will come against Egypt and anguish will come upon Cush. When the slain fall in Egypt her wealth will be carried away and her foundations torn down.
 Cush and Put Lydia and all Arabia Libya and the people of the covenant land will fall by the sword along with Egypt.
 This is what the Lord says  The allies of Egypt will fall and her proud strength will fail. From Migdol to Aswan they will fall by the sword within her declares the Sovereign Lord.
 They will be desolate among desolate lands and their cities will lie among ruined cities.
Then they will know that I am the Lord when I set fire to Egypt and all her helpers are crushed.
 On that day messengers will go out from me in ships to frighten Cush out of her complacency. Anguish will take hold of them on the day of Egypts doom for it is sure to come.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says  I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
He and his armythe most ruthless of nations will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
I will dry up the streams of the Nile and sell the land to evil men by the hand of foreigners I will lay waste the land and everything in it. I the Lord have spoken.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says  I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis. No longer will there be a prince in Egypt and I will spread fear throughout the land.
I will lay waste Upper Egypt set fire to Zoan and inflict punishment on Thebes.
I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium the stronghold of Egypt and cut off the hordes of Thebes.
I will set fire to Egypt Pelusium will writhe in agony. Thebes will be taken by storm Memphis will be in constant distress.
The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword and the cities themselves will go into captivity.
In the eleventh year in the third month on the first day the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes  Who can be compared with you in majesty?
Consider Assyria once a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest it towered on high its top above the thick foliage.
The waters nourished it deep springs made it grow tall their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field.
So it towered higher than all the trees of the field its boughs increased and its branches grew long spreading because of abundant waters.
All the birds of the air nested in its boughs all the beasts of the field gave birth under its branches all the great nations lived in its shade.
It was majestic in beauty with its spreading boughs for its roots went down to abundant waters.
The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it nor could the pine trees equal its boughs nor could the plane trees compare with its branches no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty.
I made it beautiful with abundant branches the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God.
 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says Because it towered on high lifting its top above the thick foliage and because it was proud of its height
I handed it over to the ruler of the nations for him to deal with according to its wickedness. I cast it aside
and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it. Its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it.
All the birds of the air settled on the fallen tree and all the beasts of the field were among its branches.
Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so wellwatered are ever to reach such a height they are all destined for death for the earth below among mortal men with those who go down to the pit.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says On the day it was brought down to the grave I covered the deep springs with mourning for it I held back its streams and its abundant waters were restrained. Because of it I clothed Lebanon with gloom and all the trees of the field withered away.
I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the grave with those who go down to the pit. Then all the trees of Eden the choicest and best of Lebanon all the trees that were wellwatered were consoled in the earth below.
Those who lived in its shade its allies among the nations had also gone down to the grave with it joining those killed by the sword.
 Which of the trees of Eden can be compared with you in splendor and majesty? Yet you too will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below you will lie among the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword.  This is Pharaoh and all his hordes declares the Sovereign Lord. 
In the twelfth year in the twelfth month on the first day the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man take up a lament concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him  You are like a lion among the nations you are like a monster in the seas thrashing about in your streams churning the water with your feet and muddying the streams.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says  With a great throng of people I will cast my net over you and they will haul you up in my net.
I will throw you on the land and hurl you on the open field. I will let all the birds of the air settle on you and all the beasts of the earth gorge themselves on you.
I will spread your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains.
I will drench the land with your flowing blood all the way to the mountains and the ravines will be filled with your flesh.
When I snuff you out I will cover the heavens and darken their stars I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon will not give its light.
All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you I will bring darkness over your land declares the Sovereign Lord.
I will trouble the hearts of many peoples when I bring about your destruction among the nations among lands you have not known.
I will cause many peoples to be appalled at you and their kings will shudder with horror because of you when I brandish my sword before them. On the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life.
 For this is what the Sovereign Lord says  The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you.
I will cause your hordes to fall by the swords of mighty men the most ruthless of all nations. They will shatter the pride of Egypt and all her hordes will be overthrown.
I will destroy all her cattle from beside abundant waters no longer to be stirred by the foot of man or muddied by the hoofs of cattle.
Then I will let her waters settle and make her streams flow like oil declares the Sovereign Lord.
When I make Egypt desolate and strip the land of everything in it when I strike down all who live there then they will know that I am the Lord.
This is the lament they will chant for her. The daughters of the nations will chant it for Egypt and all her hordes they will chant it declares the Sovereign Lord.
In the twelfth year on the fifteenth day of the month the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man wail for the hordes of Egypt and consign to the earth below both her and the daughters of mighty nations with those who go down to the pit.
Say to them Are you more favored than others? Go down and be laid among the uncircumcised.
They will fall among those killed by the sword. The sword is drawn let her be dragged off with all her hordes.
From within the grave the mighty leaders will say of Egypt and her allies They have come down and they lie with the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword.
Assyria is there with her whole army she is surrounded by the graves of all her slain all who have fallen by the sword.
Their graves are in the depths of the pit and her army lies around her grave. All who had spread terror in the land of the living are slain fallen by the sword.
Elam is there with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain fallen by the sword. All who had spread terror in the land of the living went down uncircumcised to the earth below. They bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
A bed is made for her among the slain with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised killed by the sword. Because their terror had spread in the land of the living they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit they are laid among the slain.
Meshech and Tubal are there with all their hordes around their graves. All of them are uncircumcised killed by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living.
Do they not lie with the other uncircumcised warriors who have fallen who went down to the grave with their weapons of war whose swords were placed under their heads? The punishment for their sins rested on their bones though the terror of these warriors had stalked through the land of the living.
You too O Pharaoh will be broken and will lie among the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword.
Edom is there her kings and all her princes despite their power they are laid with those killed by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised with those who go down to the pit.
All the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there they went down with the slain in disgrace despite the terror caused by their power. They lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
Pharaohhe and all his armywill see them and he will be consoled for all his hordes that were killed by the sword declares the Sovereign Lord.
Although I had him spread terror in the land of the living Pharaoh and all his hordes will be laid among the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword declares the Sovereign Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man speak to your countrymen and say to them When I bring the sword against a land and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman
and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people
then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not take warning and the sword comes and takes his life his blood will be on his own head.
Since he heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning his blood will be on his own head. If he had taken warning he would have saved himself.
But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes the life of one of them that man will be taken away because of his sin but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.
Son of man I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.
When I say to the wicked O wicked man you will surely die and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways that wicked man will die for his sin and I will hold you accountable for his blood.
But if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways and he does not do so he will die for his sin but you will have saved yourself.
Son of man say to the house of Israel This is what you are saying Our offenses and sins weigh us down and we are wasting away because of them. How then can we live? 
Say to them As surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die O house of Israel?
Therefore son of man say to your countrymen The righteousness of the righteous man will not save him when he disobeys and the wickedness of the wicked man will not cause him to fall when he turns from it. The righteous man if he sins will not be allowed to live because of his former righteousness.
If I tell the righteous man that he will surely live but then he trusts in his righteousness and does evil none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered he will die for the evil he has done.
And if I say to the wicked man You will surely die but he then turns away from his sin and does what is just and right
if he gives back what he took in pledge for a loan returns what he has stolen follows the decrees that give life and does no evil he will surely live he will not die.
None of the sins he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right he will surely live.
Yet your countrymen say The way of the Lord is not just. But it is their way that is not just.
If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil he will die for it.
And if a wicked man turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and right he will live by doing so.
Yet O house of Israel you say The way of the Lord is not just. But I will judge each of you according to his own ways.
In the twelfth year of our exile in the tenth month on the fifth day a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said The city has fallen!
Now the evening before the man arrived the hand of the Lord was upon me and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent.
Then the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying Abraham was only one man yet he possessed the land. But we are many surely the land has been given to us as our possession.
Therefore say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood should you then possess the land?
You rely on your sword you do detestable things and each of you defiles his neighbors wife. Should you then possess the land?
Say this to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says As surely as I live those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague.
I will make the land a desolate waste and her proud strength will come to an end and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them.
Then they will know that I am the Lord when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done.
As for you son of man your countrymen are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses saying to each other Come and hear the message that has come from the Lord.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man prophesy against the shepherds of Israel prophesy and say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?
You eat the curds clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals but you do not take care of the flock.
You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.
So they were scattered because there was no shepherd and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals.
My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth and no one searched or looked for them.
 Therefore you shepherds hear the word of the Lord
As surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock
therefore O shepherds hear the word of the Lord
This is what the Sovereign Lord says I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths and it will no longer be food for them.
 For this is what the Sovereign Lord says I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.
As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land.
I will tend them in a good pasture and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man set your face against Mount Seir prophesy against it
and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says I am against you Mount Seir and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste.
I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
 Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity the time their punishment reached its climax
therefore as surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed bloodshed will pursue you.
I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go.
I will fill your mountains with the slain those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines.
I will make you desolate forever your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
 Because you have said These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them even though I the Lord was there
therefore as surely as I live declares the Sovereign Lord I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.
Then you will know that I the Lord have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.
You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint and I heard it.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says While the whole earth rejoices I will make you desolate.
Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate O Mount Seir you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the Lord. 
Son of man prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say O mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says The enemy said of you Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession. 
Therefore prophesy and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says Because they ravaged and hounded you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of peoples malicious talk and slander
therefore O mountains of Israel hear the word of the Sovereign Lord This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you
this is what the Sovereign Lord says In my burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations and against all Edom for with glee and with malice in their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they might plunder its pastureland.
Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys This is what the Sovereign Lord says I speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I swear with uplifted hand that the nations around you will also suffer scorn.
 But you O mountains of Israel will produce branches and fruit for my people Israel for they will soon come home.
I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor you will be plowed and sown
and I will multiply the number of people upon you even the whole house of Israel. The towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.
I will increase the number of men and animals upon you and they will be fruitful and become numerous. I will settle people on you as in the past and will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
I will cause people my people Israel to walk upon you. They will possess you and you will be their inheritance you will never again deprive them of their children.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says Because people say to you You devour men and deprive your nation of its children
therefore you will no longer devour men or make your nation childless declares the Sovereign Lord.
No longer will I make you hear the taunts of the nations and no longer will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to fall declares the Sovereign Lord. 
Again the word of the Lord came to me
Son of man when the people of Israel were living in their own land they defiled it by their conduct and their actions. Their conduct was like a womans monthly uncleanness in my sight.
So I poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols.
I dispersed them among the nations and they were scattered through the countries I judged them according to their conduct and their actions.
And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name for it was said of them These are the Lords people and yet they had to leave his land.
I had concern for my holy name which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they had gone.
Therefore say to the house of Israel This is what the Sovereign Lord says It is not for your sake O house of Israel that I am going to do these things but for the sake of my holy name which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.
I will show the holiness of my great name which has been profaned among the nations the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord declares the Sovereign Lord when I show myself holy through you before their eyes.
 For I will take you out of the nations I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.
I will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
The hand of the Lord was upon me and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley it was full of bones.
He led me back and forth among them and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley bones that were very dry.
He asked me Son of man can these bones live? I said O Sovereign Lord you alone know.
Then he said to me Prophesy to these bones and say to them Dry bones hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones I will make breath enter you and you will come to life.
I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin I will put breath in you and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 
So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying there was a noise a rattling sound and the bones came together bone to bone.
I looked and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them but there was no breath in them.
Then he said to me Prophesy to the breath prophesy son of man and say to it This is what the Sovereign Lord says Come from the four winds O breath and breathe into these slain that they may live. 
So I prophesied as he commanded me and breath entered them they came to life and stood up on their feeta vast army.
Then he said to me Son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone we are cut off.
Therefore prophesy and say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says O my people I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them I will bring you back to the land of Israel.
Then you my people will know that I am the Lord when I open your graves and bring you up from them.
I will put my Spirit in you and you will live and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken and I have done it declares the Lord. 
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man take a stick of wood and write on it Belonging to Judah and the Israelites associated with him. Then take another stick of wood and write on it Ephraims stick belonging to Joseph and all the house of Israel associated with him.
Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand.
When your countrymen ask you Wont you tell us what you mean by this?
say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says I am going to take the stick of Josephwhich is in Ephraims handand of the Israelite tribes associated with him and join it to Judahs stick making them a single stick of wood and they will become one in my hand.
Hold before their eyes the sticks you have written on
and say to them This is what the Sovereign Lord says I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land.
I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel. There will be one king over all of them and they will never again be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms.
The word of the Lord came to me
Son of man set your face against Gog of the land of Magog the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal prophesy against him
and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says I am against you O Gog chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
I will turn you around put hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your whole armyyour horses your horsemen fully armed and a great horde with large and small shields all of them brandishing their swords.
Persia Cush and Put will be with them all with shields and helmets
also Gomer with all its troops and Beth Togarmah from the far north with all its troopsthe many nations with you.
 Get ready be prepared you and all the hordes gathered about you and take command of them.
After many days you will be called to arms. In future years you will invade a land that has recovered from war whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations and now all of them live in safety.
You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up advancing like a storm you will be like a cloud covering the land.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says On that day thoughts will come into your mind and you will devise an evil scheme.
You will say I will invade a land of unwalled villages I will attack a peaceful and unsuspecting peopleall of them living without walls and without gates and bars.
I will plunder and loot and turn my hand against the resettled ruins and the people gathered from the nations rich in livestock and goods living at the center of the land.
Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all her villages will say to you Have you come to plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot to carry off silver and gold to take away livestock and goods and to seize much plunder? 
Therefore son of man prophesy and say to Gog This is what the Sovereign Lord says In that day when my people Israel are living in safety will you not take notice of it?
You will come from your place in the far north you and many nations with you all of them riding on horses a great horde a mighty army.
You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come O Gog I will bring you against my land so that the nations may know me when I show myself holy through you before their eyes.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says Are you not the one I spoke of in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel? At that time they prophesied for years that I would bring you against them.
This is what will happen in that day When Gog attacks the land of Israel my hot anger will be aroused declares the Sovereign Lord.
In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
The fish of the sea the birds of the air the beasts of the field every creature that moves along the ground and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned the cliffs will crumble and every wall will fall to the ground.
I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains declares the Sovereign Lord. Every mans sword will be against his brother.
I will execute judgment upon him with plague and bloodshed I will pour down torrents of rain hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him.
And so I will show my greatness and my holiness and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
Son of man prophesy against Gog and say This is what the Sovereign Lord says I am against you O Gog chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
I will turn you around and drag you along. I will bring you from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel.
Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand.
On the mountains of Israel you will fall you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to all kinds of carrion birds and to the wild animals.
You will fall in the open field for I have spoken declares the Sovereign Lord.
I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands and they will know that I am the Lord.
 I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer let my holy name be profaned and the nations will know that I the Lord am the Holy One in Israel.
It is coming! It will surely take place declares the Sovereign Lord. This is the day I have spoken of.
 Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them upthe small and large shields the bows and arrows the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel.
They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests because they will use the weapons for fuel. And they will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them declares the Sovereign Lord.
 On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel in the valley of those who travel east toward the Sea. It will block the way of travelers because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog.
 For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
All the people of the land will bury them and the day I am glorified will be a memorable day for them declares the Sovereign Lord.
 Men will be regularly employed to cleanse the land. Some will go throughout the land and in addition to them others will bury those that remain on the ground. At the end of the seven months they will begin their search.
As they go through the land and one of them sees a human bone he will set up a marker beside it until the gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog.
And so they will cleanse the land.
Son of man this is what the Sovereign Lord says Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood.
You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth as if they were rams and lambs goats and bullsall of them fattened animals from Bashan.
At the sacrifice I am preparing for you you will eat fat till you are glutted and drink blood till you are drunk.
At my table you will eat your fill of horses and riders mighty men and soldiers of every kind declares the Sovereign Lord.
I will display my glory among the nations and all the nations will see the punishment I inflict and the hand I lay upon them.
From that day forward the house of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God.
And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies and they all fell by the sword.
I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offenses and I hid my face from them.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says I will now bring Jacob back from captivity and will have compassion on all the people of Israel and I will be zealous for my holy name.
They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid.
When I have brought them back from the nations and have gathered them from the countries of their enemies I will show myself holy through them in the sight of many nations.
Then they will know that I am the Lord their God for though I sent them into exile among the nations I will gather them to their own land not leaving any behind.
I will no longer hide my face from them for I will pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel declares the Sovereign Lord.
In the twentyfifth year of our exile at the beginning of the year on the tenth of the month in the fourteenth year after the fall of the cityon that very day the hand of the Lord was upon me and he took me there.
In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city.
He took me there and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.
The man said to me Son of man look with your eyes and hear with your ears and pay attention to everything I am going to show you for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything you see.
I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the mans hand was six long cubits each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high.
Then he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate it was one rod deep.
The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep.
Then he measured the portico of the gateway
it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple.
Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side the three had the same measurements and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements.
Then he measured the width of the entrance to the gateway it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.
In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high and the alcoves were six cubits square.
Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one the distance was twentyfive cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one.
He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gatewaysixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico facing the courtyard.
The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits.
The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around as was the portico the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees.
Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court there were thirty rooms along the pavement.
It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long this was the lower pavement.
Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.
Then he measured the length and width of the gate facing north leading into the outer court.
Its alcovesthree on each sideits projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twentyfive cubits wide.
Its openings its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it with its portico opposite them.
There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one it was a hundred cubits.
Then he led me to the south side and I saw a gate facing south. He measured its jambs and its portico and they had the same measurements as the others.
The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twentyfive cubits wide.
Then the man brought me to the outer sanctuary and measured the jambs the width of the jambs was six cubits on each side.
The entrance was ten cubits wide and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits wide. He also measured the outer sanctuary it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.
Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance each was two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits wide.
And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary it was twenty cubits and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the outer sanctuary. He said to me This is the Most Holy Place.
Then he measured the wall of the temple it was six cubits thick and each side room around the temple was four cubits wide.
The side rooms were on three levels one above another thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple.
The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor.
I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod six long cubits.
The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple
and the priests rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple.
There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area one on the north and another on the south and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around.
The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around and its length was ninety cubits.
Then he measured the temple it was a hundred cubits long and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long.
The width of the temple courtyard on the east including the front of the temple was a hundred cubits.
Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple including its galleries on each side it was a hundred cubits. The outer sanctuary the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court
as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of themeverything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor the wall up to the windows and the windows were covered.
In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary
were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces
the face of a man toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple.
Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side.
The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
Both in the section twenty cubits from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court gallery faced gallery at the three levels.
In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were on the north.
Now the upper rooms were narrower for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building.
The rooms on the third floor had no pillars as the courts had so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors.
There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits.
While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long.
The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
On the south side along the length of the wall of the outer court adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall were rooms
with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north they had the same length and width with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north
were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward by which one enters the rooms.
Then he said to me The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests rooms where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offeringsthe grain offerings the sin offerings and the guilt offeringsfor the place is holy.
Once the priests enter the holy precincts they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.
When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around
He measured the east side with the measuring rod it was five hundred cubits.
He measured the north side it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
He measured the south side it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
Then he turned to the west side and measured it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.
So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide to separate the holy from the common.
Then the man brought me to the gate facing east
and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of rushing waters and the land was radiant with his glory.
The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when he came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River and I fell facedown.
The glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east.
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
While the man was standing beside me I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple.
He said Son of man this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet. This is where I will live among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will never again defile my holy nameneither they nor their kingsby their prostitution and the lifeless idols of their kings at their high places.
When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts with only a wall between me and them they defiled my holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger.
Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the lifeless idols of their kings and I will live among them forever.
Son of man describe the temple to the people of Israel that they may be ashamed of their sins. Let them consider the plan
and if they are ashamed of all they have done make known to them the design of the templeits arrangement its exits and entrancesits whole design and all its regulations and laws. Write these down before them so that they may be faithful to its design and follow all its regulations.
This is the law of the temple All the surrounding area on top of the mountain will be most holy. Such is the law of the temple.
These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits that cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth Its gutter is a cubit deep and a cubit wide with a rim of one span around the edge. And this is the height of the altar
From the gutter on the ground up to the lower ledge it is two cubits high and a cubit wide and from the smaller ledge up to the larger ledge it is four cubits high and a cubit wide.
The altar hearth is four cubits high and four horns project upward from the hearth.
The altar hearth is square twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide.
The upper ledge also is square fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide with a rim of half a cubit and a gutter of a cubit all around. The steps of the altar face east.
Then he said to me Son of man this is what the Sovereign Lord says These will be the regulations for sacrificing burnt offerings and sprinkling blood upon the altar when it is built
You are to give a young bull as a sin offering to the priests who are Levites of the family of Zadok who come near to minister before me declares the Sovereign Lord.
You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the upper ledge and all around the rim and so purify the altar and make atonement for it.
You are to take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
On the second day you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering and the altar is to be purified as it was purified with the bull.
When you have finished purifying it you are to offer a young bull and a ram from the flock both without defect.
You are to offer them before the Lord and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the Lord.
For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock both without defect.
For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it thus they will dedicate it.
At the end of these days from the eighth day on the priests are to present your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you declares the Sovereign Lord.
Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary the one facing east and it was shut.
The Lord said to me This gate is to remain shut. It must not be opened no one may enter through it. It is to remain shut because the Lord the God of Israel has entered through it.
The prince himself is the only one who may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the Lord. He is to enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way.
Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked and saw the glory of the Lord filling the temple of the Lord and I fell facedown.
The Lord said to me Son of man look carefully listen closely and give attention to everything I tell you concerning all the regulations regarding the temple of the Lord. Give attention to the entrance of the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary.
Say to the rebellious house of Israel This is what the Sovereign Lord says Enough of your detestable practices O house of Israel!
In addition to all your other detestable practices you brought foreigners uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary desecrating my temple while you offered me food fat and blood and you broke my covenant.
Instead of carrying out your duty in regard to my holy things you put others in charge of my sanctuary.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh is to enter my sanctuary not even the foreigners who live among the Israelites.
 The Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray and who wandered from me after their idols must bear the consequences of their sin.
They may serve in my sanctuary having charge of the gates of the temple and serving in it they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before the people and serve them.
But because they served them in the presence of their idols and made the house of Israel fall into sin therefore I have sworn with uplifted hand that they must bear the consequences of their sin declares the Sovereign Lord.
They are not to come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my holy things or my most holy offerings they must bear the shame of their detestable practices.
Yet I will put them in charge of the duties of the temple and all the work that is to be done in it.
 But the priests who are Levites and descendants of Zadok and who faithfully carried out the duties of my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me are to come near to minister before me they are to stand before me to offer sacrifices of fat and blood declares the Sovereign Lord.
They alone are to enter my sanctuary they alone are to come near my table to minister before me and perform my service.

 When you allot the land as an inheritance you are to present to the Lord a portion of the land as a sacred district 25000 cubits long and 20000 cubits wide the entire area will be holy.
Of this a section 500 cubits square is to be for the sanctuary with 50 cubits around it for open land.

An area 25000 cubits long and 10000 cubits wide will belong to the Levites who serve in the temple as their possession for towns to live in.
 You are to give the city as its property an area 5000 cubits wide and 25000 cubits long adjoining the sacred portion it will belong to the whole house of Israel.
 The prince will have the land bordering each side of the area formed by the sacred district and the property of the city. It will extend westward from the west side and eastward from the east side running lengthwise from the western to the eastern border parallel to one of the tribal portions.
This land will be his possession in Israel. And my princes will no longer oppress my people but will allow the house of Israel to possess the land according to their tribes.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says You have gone far enough O princes of Israel! Give up your violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing my people declares the Sovereign Lord.
You are to use accurate scales an accurate ephah and an accurate bath.
The ephah and the bath are to be the same size the bath containing a tenth of a homer and the ephah a tenth of a homer the homer is to be the standard measure for both.
The shekel is to consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twentyfive shekels plus fifteen shekels equal one mina.
 This is the special gift you are to offer a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.
The prescribed portion of oil measured by the bath is a tenth of a bath from each cor .
Also one sheep is to be taken from every flock of two hundred from the wellwatered pastures of Israel. These will be used for the grain offerings burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the people declares the Sovereign Lord.
All the people of the land will participate in this special gift for the use of the prince in Israel.
It will be the duty of the prince to provide the burnt offerings grain offerings and drink offerings at the festivals the New Moons and the Sabbathsat all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings grain offerings burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says In the first month on the first day you are to take a young bull without defect and purify the sanctuary.
The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar and on the gateposts of the inner court.
You are to do the same on the seventh day of the month for anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance so you are to make atonement for the temple.
 In the first month on the fourteenth day you are to observe the Passover a feast lasting seven days during which you shall eat bread made without yeast.
On that day the prince is to provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.
Every day during the seven days of the Feast he is to provide seven bulls and seven rams without defect as a burnt offering to the Lord and a male goat for a sin offering.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says The gate of the inner court facing east is to be shut on the six working days but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it is to be opened.
The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost. The priests are to sacrifice his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings. He is to worship at the threshold of the gateway and then go out but the gate will not be shut until evening.
On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are to worship in the presence of the Lord at the entrance to that gateway.
The burnt offering the prince brings to the Lord on the Sabbath day is to be six male lambs and a ram all without defect.
The grain offering given with the ram is to be an ephah and the grain offering with the lambs is to be as much as he pleases along with a hin of oil for each ephah.
On the day of the New Moon he is to offer a young bull six lambs and a ram all without defect.
He is to provide as a grain offering one ephah with the bull one ephah with the ram and with the lambs as much as he wants to give along with a hin of oil with each ephah.
When the prince enters he is to go in through the portico of the gateway and he is to come out the same way.
 When the people of the land come before the Lord at the appointed feasts whoever enters by the north gate to worship is to go out the south gate and whoever enters by the south gate is to go out the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which he entered but each is to go out the opposite gate.

So the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering.
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says If the prince makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his sons it will also belong to his descendants it is to be their property by inheritance.
If however he makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants the servant may keep it until the year of freedom then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs to his sons only it is theirs.
The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people driving them off their property. He is to give his sons their inheritance out of his own property so that none of my people will be separated from his property. 
Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north which belonged to the priests and showed me a place at the western end.
He said to me This is the place where the priests will cook the guilt offering and the sin offering and bake the grain offering to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people.
He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners and I saw in each corner another court.
In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed courts forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide each of the courts in the four corners was the same size.
The man brought me back to the entrance of the temple and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east . The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple south of the altar.
He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east and the water was flowing from the south side.
As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand he measured off a thousand cubits and then led me through water that was ankledeep.
He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was kneedeep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist.
He measured off another thousand but now it was a river that I could not cross because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim ina river that no one could cross.
He asked me Son of man do you see this? Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
When I arrived there I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river.
He said to me This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah where it enters the Sea. When it empties into the Sea the water there becomes fresh.
Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh so where the river flows everything will live.
Fishermen will stand along the shore from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kindslike the fish of the Great Sea.
But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh they will be left for salt.
Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says These are the boundaries by which you are to divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel with two portions for Joseph.
You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your forefathers this land will become your inheritance.
This is to be the boundary of the land On the north side it will run from the Great Sea by the Hethlon road past Lebo Hamath to Zedad
Berothah and Sibraim  as far as Hazer Hatticon which is on the border of Hauran.
The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan along the northern border of Damascus with the border of Hamath to the north. This will be the north boundary.
On the west side the Great Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This will be the west boundary.
You are to distribute this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who have settled among you and who have children. You are to consider them as nativeborn Israelites along with you they are to be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
In whatever tribe the alien settles there you are to give him his inheritance declares the Sovereign Lord.

The special portion you are to offer to the Lord will be 25000 cubits long and 10000 cubits wide.
This will be the sacred portion for the priests. It will be 25000 cubits long on the north side 10000 cubits wide on the west side 10000 cubits wide on the east side and 25000 cubits long on the south side. In the center of it will be the sanctuary of the Lord.
This will be for the consecrated priests the Zadokites who were faithful in serving me and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray.
It will be a special gift to them from the sacred portion of the land a most holy portion bordering the territory of the Levites.
Alongside the territory of the priests the Levites will have an allotment 25000 cubits long and 10000 cubits wide. Its total length will be 25000 cubits and its width 10000 cubits.
They must not sell or exchange any of it. This is the best of the land and must not pass into other hands because it is holy to the Lord.
The remaining area 5000 cubits wide and 25000 cubits long will be for the common use of the city for houses and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it

The workers from the city who farm it will come from all the tribes of Israel.
The entire portion will be a square 25000 cubits on each side. As a special gift you will set aside the sacred portion along with the property of the city.
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand along with some of the articles from the temple of God. These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia and put in the treasure house of his god.
Then the king ordered Ashpenaz chief of his court officials to bring in some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility
young men without any physical defect handsome showing aptitude for every kind of learning well informed quick to understand and qualified to serve in the kings palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians.
The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the kings table. They were to be trained for three years and after that they were to enter the kings service.
Among these were some from Judah Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah.
The chief official gave them new names to Daniel the name Belteshazzar to Hananiah Shadrach to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abednego.
But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.
Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel
but the official told Daniel I am afraid of my lord the king who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would then have my head because of you.
Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah
Please test your servants for ten days Give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.
Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food and treat your servants in accordance with what you see.
So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.
At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.
So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead.
To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.
At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
The king talked with them and he found none equal to Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah so they entered the kings service.
In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.
And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
In the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar had dreams his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.
So the king summoned the magicians enchanters sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king
he said to them I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means.
Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic O king live forever! Tell your servants the dream and we will interpret it.
The king replied to the astrologers This is what I have firmly decided If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.
But if you tell me the dream and explain it you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.
Once more they replied Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will interpret it.
Then the king answered I am certain that you are trying to gain time because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided
If you do not tell me the dream there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things hoping the situation will change. So then tell me the dream and I will know that you can interpret it for me.
The astrologers answered the king There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king however great and mighty has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.
What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods and they do not live among men.
This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.
So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.
When Arioch the commander of the kings guard had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.
He asked the kings officer Why did the king issue such a harsh decree? Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.
At this Daniel went in to the king and asked for time so that he might interpret the dream for him.
Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah Mishael and Azariah.
He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven
and said Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever wisdom and power are his.
He changes times and seasons he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
He reveals deep and hidden things he knows what lies in darkness and light dwells with him.
I thank and praise you O God of my fathers You have given me wisdom and power you have made known to me what we asked of you you have made known to us the dream of the king.
Then Daniel went to Arioch whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon and said to him Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king and I will interpret his dream for him.
Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.
The king asked Daniel  Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?
Daniel replied No wise man enchanter magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about
but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these
As you were lying there O king your mind turned to things to come and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.
King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold ninety feet high and nine feet wide and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
He then summoned the satraps prefects governors advisers treasurers judges magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up.
So the satraps prefects governors advisers treasurers judges magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up and they stood before it.
Then the herald loudly proclaimed This is what you are commanded to do O peoples nations and men of every language
As soon as you hear the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.
Therefore as soon as they heard the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp and all kinds of music all the peoples nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
At this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews.
They said to King Nebuchadnezzar O king live forever!
You have issued a decree O king that everyone who hears the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold
and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace.
But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of BabylonShadrach Meshach and Abednegowho pay no attention to you O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.
Furious with rage Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king
and Nebuchadnezzar said to them Is it true Shadrach Meshach and Abednego that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?
Now when you hear the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made very good. But if you do not worship it you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?
Shadrach Meshach and Abednego replied to the king O Nebuchadnezzar we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.
If we are thrown into the blazing furnace the God we serve is able to save us from it and he will rescue us from your hand O king.
But even if he does not we want you to know O king that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.
Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual
and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.
So these men wearing their robes trousers turbans and other clothes were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
The kings command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
and these three men firmly tied fell into the blazing furnace.
Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers Werent there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire? They replied Certainly O king.
He said Look! I see four men walking around in the fire unbound and unharmed and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.
Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted Shadrach Meshach and Abednego servants of the Most High God come out! Come here! So Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire
and the satraps prefects governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies nor was a hair of their heads singed their robes were not scorched and there was no smell of fire on them.
Then Nebuchadnezzar said Praise be to the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the kings command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble for no other god can save in this way.
Then the king promoted Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
King Nebuchadnezzar To the peoples nations and men of every language who live in all the world May you prosper greatly!
It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.
How great are his signs how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom his dominion endures from generation to generation.
I Nebuchadnezzar was at home in my palace contented and prosperous.
I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in my bed the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me.
So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.
When the magicians enchanters astrologers and diviners came I told them the dream but they could not interpret it for me.
Finally Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream.
I said Belteshazzar chief of the magicians I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream interpret it for me.
These are the visions I saw while lying in my bed I looked and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous.
The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky it was visible to the ends of the earth.
Its leaves were beautiful its fruit abundant and on it was food for all. Under it the beasts of the field found shelter and the birds of the air lived in its branches from it every creature was fed.
In the visions I saw while lying in my bed I looked and there before me was a messenger a holy one coming down from heaven.
He called in a loud voice Cut down the tree and trim off its branches strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
But let the stump and its roots bound with iron and bronze remain in the ground in the grass of the field.  Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth.
Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal till seven times pass by for him.
 The decision is announced by messengers the holy ones declare the verdict so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of men.
This is the dream that I King Nebuchadnezzar had. Now Belteshazzar tell me what it means for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.
Then Daniel  was greatly perplexed for a time and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said Belteshazzar do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you. Belteshazzar answered My lord if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries!
The tree you saw which grew large and strong with its top touching the sky visible to the whole earth
with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit providing food for all giving shelter to the beasts of the field and having nesting places in its branches for the birds of the air
you O king are that tree! You have become great and strong your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.
You O king saw a messenger a holy one coming down from heaven and saying Cut down the tree and destroy it but leave the stump bound with iron and bronze in the grass of the field while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven let him live like the wild animals until seven times pass by for him.
This is the interpretation O king and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king
You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.
The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
Therefore O king be pleased to accept my advice Renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.
All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
Twelve months later as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon
he said Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?
King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.
While Belshazzar was drinking his wine he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem so that the king and his nobles his wives and his concubines might drink from them.
So they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem and the king and his nobles his wives and his concubines drank from them.
As they drank the wine they praised the gods of gold and silver of bronze iron wood and stone.
Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.
His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.
The king called out for the enchanters astrologers and diviners to be brought and said to these wise men of Babylon Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
Then all the kings wise men came in but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant.
So King Belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale. His nobles were baffled.
The queen hearing the voices of the king and his nobles came into the banquet hall. O king live forever! she said. Dont be alarmed! Dont look so pale!
There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar your fatheryour father the king I sayappointed him chief of the magicians enchanters astrologers and diviners.
This man Daniel whom the king called Belteshazzar was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding and also the ability to interpret dreams explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel and he will tell you what the writing means.
So Daniel was brought before the king and the king said to him Are you Daniel one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?
I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight intelligence and outstanding wisdom.
The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means but they could not explain it.
Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
Then Daniel answered the king You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.
O king the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.
Because of the high position he gave him all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death he put to death those he wanted to spare he spared those he wanted to promote he promoted and those he wanted to humble he humbled.
But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.
He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes.
But you his son O Belshazzar have not humbled yourself though you knew all this.
Instead you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you and you and your nobles your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold of bronze iron wood and stone which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways.
Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.
This is the inscription that was written MENE MENE TEKEL PARSIN
This is what these words mean Mene God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.
Tekel You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.
It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom
with three administrators over them one of whom was Daniel. The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss.
Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
At this the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.
Finally these men said We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.
So the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said O King Darius live forever!
The royal administrators prefects satraps advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days except to you O king shall be thrown into the lions den.
Now O king issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be alteredin accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians which cannot be repealed.
So King Darius put the decree in writing.
Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed giving thanks to his God just as he had done before.
Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.
So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you O king would be thrown into the lions den? The king answered The decree standsin accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians which cannot be repealed.
Then they said to the king Daniel who is one of the exiles from Judah pays no attention to you O king or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.
When the king heard this he was greatly distressed he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.
Then the men went as a group to the king and said to him Remember O king that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.
So the king gave the order and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions den. The king said to Daniel May your God whom you serve continually rescue you!
A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles so that Daniels situation might not be changed.
Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.
At the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions den.
When he came near the den he called to Daniel in an anguished voice Daniel servant of the living God has your God whom you serve continually been able to rescue you from the lions?
Daniel answered O king live forever!
My God sent his angel and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you O king.
The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den no wound was found on him because he had trusted in his God.
At the kings command the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions den along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples nations and men of every language throughout the land May you prosper greatly!
I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel. For he is the living God and he endures forever his kingdom will not be destroyed his dominion will never end.
He rescues and he saves he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.
So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.
Daniel said In my vision at night I looked and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.
Four great beasts each different from the others came up out of the sea.
The first was like a lion and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man and the heart of a man was given to it.
And there before me was a second beast which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told Get up and eat your fill of flesh!
After that I looked and there before me was another beast one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads and it was given authority to rule.
After that in my vision at night I looked and there before me was a fourth beastterrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts and it had ten horns.
While I was thinking about the horns there before me was another horn a little one which came up among them and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
As I looked thrones were set in place and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire and its wheels were all ablaze.
A river of fire was flowing coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated and the books were opened.
Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.

In my vision at night I looked and there before me was one like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.
He was given authority glory and sovereign power all peoples nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
I Daniel was troubled in spirit and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.
I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things
The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.
But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it foreveryes for ever and ever.
Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast which was different from all the others and most terrifying with its iron teeth and bronze clawsthe beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.
I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up before which three of them fellthe horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
As I watched this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them
until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.
He gave me this explanation The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth trampling it down and crushing it.
The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise different from the earlier ones he will subdue three kings.
He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time times and half a time.
 But the court will sit and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.
In the third year of King Belshazzars reign I Daniel had a vision after the one that had already appeared to me.
In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.
I looked up and there before me was a ram with two horns standing beside the canal and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.
I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.
As I was thinking about this suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.
He came toward the twohorned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage.
I saw him attack the ram furiously striking the ram and shattering his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him and none could rescue the ram from his power.
The goat became very great but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.
Out of one of them came another horn which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.
It grew until it reached the host of the heavens and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.
It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host it took away the daily sacrifice from him and the place of his sanctuary was brought low.
Because of rebellion the host of the saints and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did and truth was thrown to the ground.
Then I heard a holy one speaking and another holy one said to him How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilledthe vision concerning the daily sacrifice the rebellion that causes desolation and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?
He said to me It will take 2300 evenings and mornings then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.
While I Daniel was watching the vision and trying to understand it there before me stood one who looked like a man.
And I heard a mans voice from the Ulai calling Gabriel tell this man the meaning of the vision.
As he came near the place where I was standing I was terrified and fell prostrate. Son of man he said to me understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.
While he was speaking to me I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet.
He said I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end.
The twohorned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
The shaggy goat is the king of Greece and the large horn between his eyes is the first king.
The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.
In the latter part of their reign when rebels have become completely wicked a sternfaced king a master of intrigue will arise.
He will become very strong but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people.
He will cause deceit to prosper and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed but not by human power.
The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true but seal up the vision for it concerns the distant future.
I Daniel was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the kings business. I was appalled by the vision it was beyond understanding.
In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes  who was made ruler over the Babylonian kingdom
in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood from the Scriptures according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years.
So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition in fasting and in sackcloth and ashes.
I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed O Lord the great and awesome God who keeps his covenant of love with all who love him and obey his commands
we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled we have turned away from your commands and laws.
We have not listened to your servants the prophets who spoke in your name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land.
Lord you are righteous but this day we are covered with shamethe men of Judah and people of Jerusalem and all Israel both near and far in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you.
O Lord we and our kings our princes and our fathers are covered with shame because we have sinned against you.
The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving even though we have rebelled against him
we have not obeyed the Lord our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets.
All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away refusing to obey you. Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses the servant of God have been poured out on us because we have sinned against you.
You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us great disaster. Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
Just as it is written in the Law of Moses all this disaster has come upon us yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth.
The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster upon us for the Lord our God is righteous in everything he does yet we have not obeyed him.
Now O Lord our God who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day we have sinned we have done wrong.
O Lord in keeping with all your righteous acts turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem your city your holy hill. Our sins and the iniquities of our fathers have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us.
Now our God hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake O Lord look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.
Give ear O God and hear open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous but because of your great mercy.
O Lord listen! O Lord forgive! O Lord hear and act! For your sake O my God do not delay because your city and your people bear your Name.
While I was speaking and praying confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the Lord my God for his holy hill
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a revelation was given to Daniel . Its message was true and it concerned a great war. The understanding of the message came to him in a vision.
At that time I Daniel mourned for three weeks.
I ate no choice food no meat or wine touched my lips and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.
On the twentyfourth day of the first month as I was standing on the bank of the great river the Tigris
I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen with a belt of the finest gold around his waist.
His body was like chrysolite his face like lightning his eyes like flaming torches his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze and his voice like the sound of a multitude.
I Daniel was the only one who saw the vision the men with me did not see it but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves.
So I was left alone gazing at this great vision I had no strength left my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.
Then I heard him speaking and as I listened to him I fell into a deep sleep my face to the ground.
A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
He said Daniel you who are highly esteemed consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you and stand up for I have now been sent to you. And when he said this to me I stood up trembling.
Then he continued Do not be afraid Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God your words were heard and I have come in response to them.
But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twentyone days. Then Michael one of the chief princes came to help me because I was detained there with the king of Persia.
Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future for the vision concerns a time yet to come.
While he was saying this to me I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless.
Then one who looked like a man touched my lips and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me I am overcome with anguish because of the vision my lord and I am helpless.
How can I your servant talk with you my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe.
Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength.
Do not be afraid O man highly esteemed he said. Peace! Be strong now be strong. When he spoke to me I was strengthened and said Speak my lord since you have given me strength.
So he said Do you know why I have come to you? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia and when I go the prince of Greece will come
but first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one supports me against them except Michael your prince.
And in the first year of Darius the Mede I took my stand to support and protect him.)
Now then I tell you the truth Three more kings will appear in Persia and then a fourth who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
Then a mighty king will appear who will rule with great power and do as he pleases.
After he has appeared his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants nor will it have the power he exercised because his empire will be uprooted and given to others.
The king of the South will become strong but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power.
After some years they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance but she will not retain her power and he and his power will not last. In those days she will be handed over together with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her.
One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress he will fight against them and be victorious.
He will also seize their gods their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone.
Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country.
His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress.
Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North who will raise a large army but it will be defeated.
When the army is carried off the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands yet he will not remain triumphant.
At that time Michael the great prince who protects your people will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your peopleeveryone whose name is found written in the bookwill be delivered.
Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake some to everlasting life others to shame and everlasting contempt.
Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens and those who lead many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever.
But you Daniel close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.
Then I Daniel looked and there before me stood two others one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank.
One of them said to the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?
The man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and I heard him swear by him who lives forever saying It will be for a time times and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken all these things will be completed.
I heard but I did not understand. So I asked My lord what will the outcome of all this be?
He replied Go your way Daniel because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.
Many will be purified made spotless and refined but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand but those who are wise will understand.
The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel
When the Lord began to speak through Hosea the Lord said to him Go take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the Lord.
So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim and she conceived and bore him a son.
Then the Lord said to Hosea Call him Jezreel because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
In that day I will break Israels bow in the Valley of Jezreel.
Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the Lord said to Hosea Call her LoRuhamah for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel that I should at all forgive them.
Yet I will show love to the house of Judah and I will save themnot by bow sword or battle or by horses and horsemen but by the Lord their God.
After she had weaned LoRuhamah Gomer had another son.
Then the Lord said Call him LoAmmi for you are not my people and I am not your God.
Yet the Israelites will be like the sand on the seashore which cannot be measured or counted. In the place where it was said to them You are not my people they will be called sons of the living God.
The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited and they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land for great will be the day of Jezreel.
Say of your brothers My people and of your sisters My loved one.
Rebuke your mother rebuke her for she is not my wife and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
Otherwise I will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born I will make her like a desert turn her into a parched land and slay her with thirst.
I will not show my love to her children because they are the children of adultery.
The Lord said to me Go show your love to your wife again though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.
So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley.
Then I told her You are to live with me many days you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man and I will live with you.
For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince without sacrifice or sacred stones without ephod or idol.
Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the Lord and to his blessings in the last days.
Hear the word of the Lord you Israelites because the Lord has a charge to bring against you who live in the land There is no faithfulness no love no acknowledgment of God in the land.
There is only cursing lying and murder stealing and adultery they break all bounds and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
Because of this the land mourns and all who live in it waste away the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying.
But let no man bring a charge let no man accuse another for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.
You stumble day and night and the prophets stumble with you. So I will destroy your mother
my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge I also reject you as my priests because you have ignored the law of your God I also will ignore your children.
The more the priests increased the more they sinned against me they exchanged their Glory for something disgraceful.
They feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness.
And it will be Like people like priests. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
They will eat but not have enough they will engage in prostitution but not increase because they have deserted the Lord to give themselves
to prostitution to old wine and new which take away the understanding
of my people. They consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray they are unfaithful to their God.
They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills under oak poplar and terebinth where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughtersinlaw to adultery.
I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution nor your daughtersinlaw when they commit adultery because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes a people without understanding will come to ruin!
Hear this you priests! Pay attention you Israelites! Listen O royal house! This judgment is against you You have been a snare at Mizpah a net spread out on Tabor.
The rebels are deep in slaughter. I will discipline all of them.
I know all about Ephraim Israel is not hidden from me. Ephraim you have now turned to prostitution Israel is corrupt.
Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. A spirit of prostitution is in their heart they do not acknowledge the Lord.
Israels arrogance testifies against them the Israelites even Ephraim stumble in their sin Judah also stumbles with them.
When they go with their flocks and herds to seek the Lord they will not find him he has withdrawn himself from them.
They are unfaithful to the Lord they give birth to illegitimate children. Now their New Moon festivals will devour them and their fields.
Sound the trumpet in Gibeah the horn in Ramah. Raise the battle cry in Beth Aven lead on O Benjamin.
Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of reckoning. Among the tribes of Israel I proclaim what is certain.
Judahs leaders are like those who move boundary stones. I will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water.
Come let us return to the Lord. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds.
After two days he will revive us on the third day he will restore us that we may live in his presence.
Let us acknowledge the Lord let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises he will appear he will come to us like the winter rains like the spring rains that water the earth.
What can I do with you Ephraim? What can I do with you Judah? Your love is like the morning mist like the early dew that disappears.
Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets I killed you with the words of my mouth my judgments flashed like lightning upon you.
For I desire mercy not sacrifice and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings.
Like Adam they have broken the covenant they were unfaithful to me there.
Gilead is a city of wicked men stained with footprints of blood.
As marauders lie in ambush for a man so do bands of priests they murder on the road to Shechem committing shameful crimes.
I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. There Ephraim is given to prostitution and Israel is defiled.
Also for you Judah a harvest is appointed. Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people
whenever I would heal Israel the sins of Ephraim are exposed and the crimes of Samaria revealed. They practice deceit thieves break into houses bandits rob in the streets
but they do not realize that I remember all their evil deeds. Their sins engulf them they are always before me.
They delight the king with their wickedness the princes with their lies.
They are all adulterers burning like an oven whose fire the baker need not stir from the kneading of the dough till it rises.
On the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine and he joins hands with the mockers.
Their hearts are like an oven they approach him with intrigue. Their passion smolders all night in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
All of them are hot as an oven they devour their rulers. All their kings fall and none of them calls on me.
Ephraim mixes with the nations Ephraim is a flat cake not turned over.
Foreigners sap his strength but he does not realize it. His hair is sprinkled with gray but he does not notice.
Israels arrogance testifies against him but despite all this he does not return to the Lord his God or search for him.
Ephraim is like a dove easily deceived and senseless now calling to Egypt now turning to Assyria.
When they go I will throw my net over them I will pull them down like birds of the air. When I hear them flocking together I will catch them.
Woe to them because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them because they have rebelled against me! I long to redeem them but they speak lies against me.
Put the trumpet to your lips! An eagle is over the house of the Lord because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.
Israel cries out to me O our God we acknowledge you!
But Israel has rejected what is good an enemy will pursue him.
They set up kings without my consent they choose princes without my approval. With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction.
Throw out your calfidol O Samaria! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity?
They are from Israel! This calfa craftsman has made it it is not God. It will be broken in pieces that calf of Samaria.
They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head it will produce no flour. Were it to yield grain foreigners would swallow it up.
Israel is swallowed up now she is among the nations like a worthless thing.
For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has sold herself to lovers.
Although they have sold themselves among the nations I will now gather them together. They will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king.
Though Ephraim built many altars for sin offerings these have become altars for sinning.
I wrote for them the many things of my law but they regarded them as something alien.
They offer sacrifices given to me and they eat the meat but the Lord is not pleased with them. Now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins They will return to Egypt.
Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces Judah has fortified many towns. But I will send fire upon their cities that will consume their fortresses.
Do not rejoice O Israel do not be jubilant like the other nations. For you have been unfaithful to your God you love the wages of a prostitute at every threshing floor.
Threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people the new wine will fail them.
They will not remain in the Lords land Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.
They will not pour out wine offerings to the Lord nor will their sacrifices please him. Such sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners all who eat them will be unclean. This food will be for themselves it will not come into the temple of the Lord.
What will you do on the day of your appointed feasts on the festival days of the Lord?
Even if they escape from destruction Egypt will gather them and Memphis will bury them. Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers and thorns will overrun their tents.
The days of punishment are coming the days of reckoning are at hand. Let Israel know this. Because your sins are so many and your hostility so great the prophet is considered a fool the inspired man a maniac.
The prophet along with my God is the watchman over Ephraim yet snares await him on all his paths and hostility in the house of his God.
They have sunk deep into corruption as in the days of Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins.
When I found Israel it was like finding grapes in the desert when I saw your fathers it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig tree. But when they came to Baal Peor they consecrated themselves to that shameful idol and became as vile as the thing they loved.
Ephraims glory will fly away like a bird no birth no pregnancy no conception.
Even if they rear children I will bereave them of every one. Woe to them when I turn away from them!
I have seen Ephraim like Tyre planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim will bring out their children to the slayer.
Give them O Lord what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry.
Israel was a spreading vine he brought forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased he built more altars as his land prospered he adorned his sacred stones.
Their heart is deceitful and now they must bear their guilt. The Lord will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones.
Then they will say We have no king because we did not revere the Lord. But even if we had a king what could he do for us?
They make many promises take false oaths and make agreements therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.
The people who live in Samaria fear for the calfidol of Beth Aven. Its people will mourn over it and so will its idolatrous priests those who had rejoiced over its splendor because it is taken from them into exile.
It will be carried to Assyria as tribute for the great king. Ephraim will be disgraced Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols.
Samaria and its king will float away like a twig on the surface of the waters.
The high places of wickedness will be destroyed it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then they will say to the mountains Cover us! and to the hills Fall on us!
Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned O Israel and there you have remained. Did not war overtake the evildoers in Gibeah?
When I please I will punish them nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin.
Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will drive Ephraim Judah must plow and Jacob must break up the ground.
When Israel was a child I loved him and out of Egypt I called my son.
But the more I called Israel the further they went from me. They sacrificed to the Baals and they burned incense to images.
It was I who taught Ephraim to walk taking them by the arms but they did not realize it was I who healed them.
I led them with cords of human kindness with ties of love I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them.
Will they not return to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent?
Swords will flash in their cities will destroy the bars of their gates and put an end to their plans.
My people are determined to turn from me. Even if they call to the Most High he will by no means exalt them.
How can I give you up Ephraim? How can I hand you over Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is changed within me all my compassion is aroused.
I will not carry out my fierce anger nor will I turn and devastate Ephraim. For I am God and not man the Holy One among you. I will not come in wrath.
They will follow the Lord he will roar like a lion. When he roars his children will come trembling from the west.
They will come trembling like birds from Egypt like doves from Assyria. I will settle them in their homes declares the Lord.
Ephraim has surrounded me with lies the house of Israel with deceit. And Judah is unruly against God even against the faithful Holy One.
Ephraim feeds on the wind he pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence. He makes a treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.
The Lord has a charge to bring against Judah he will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.
In the womb he grasped his brothers heel as a man he struggled with God.
He struggled with the angel and overcame him he wept and begged for his favor. He found him at Bethel and talked with him there
the Lord God Almighty the Lord is his name of renown!
But you must return to your God maintain love and justice and wait for your God always.
The merchant uses dishonest scales he loves to defraud.
Ephraim boasts I am very rich I have become wealthy. With all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin.
I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt I will make you live in tents again as in the days of your appointed feasts.
I spoke to the prophets gave them many visions and told parables through them.
Is Gilead wicked? Its people are worthless! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field.
Jacob fled to the country of Aram Israel served to get a wife and to pay for her he tended sheep.
The Lord used a prophet to bring Israel up from Egypt by a prophet he cared for him.
But Ephraim has bitterly provoked him to anger his Lord will leave upon him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt.
When Ephraim spoke men trembled he was exalted in Israel. But he became guilty of Baal worship and died.
Now they sin more and more they make idols for themselves from their silver cleverly fashioned images all of them the work of craftsmen. It is said of these people They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calfidols.
Therefore they will be like the morning mist like the early dew that disappears like chaff swirling from a threshing floor like smoke escaping through a window.
But I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt. You shall acknowledge no God but me no Savior except me.
I cared for you in the desert in the land of burning heat.
When I fed them they were satisfied when they were satisfied they became proud then they forgot me.
So I will come upon them like a lion like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
Like a bear robbed of her cubs I will attack them and rip them open. Like a lion I will devour them a wild animal will tear them apart.
Return O Israel to the Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall!
Take words with you and return to the Lord. Say to him Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously that we may offer the fruit of our lips.
Assyria cannot save us we will not mount warhorses. We will never again say Our gods to what our own hands have made for in you the fatherless find compassion.
I will heal their waywardness and love them freely for my anger has turned away from them.
I will be like the dew to Israel he will blossom like a lily. Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots
his young shoots will grow. His splendor will be like an olive tree his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.
Men will dwell again in his shade. He will flourish like the grain. He will blossom like a vine and his fame will be like the wine from Lebanon.
O Ephraim what more have I to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a green pine tree your fruitfulness comes from me.
Who is wise? He will realize these things. Who is discerning? He will understand them. The ways of the Lord are right the righteous walk in them but the rebellious stumble in them.
The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Pethuel.
Hear this you elders listen all who live in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your forefathers?
Tell it to your children and let your children tell it to their children and their children to the next generation.
What the locust swarm has left the great locusts have eaten what the great locusts have left the young locusts have eaten what the young locusts have left other locusts have eaten.
Wake up you drunkards and weep! Wail all you drinkers of wine wail because of the new wine for it has been snatched from your lips.
A nation has invaded my land powerful and without number it has the teeth of a lion the fangs of a lioness.
It has laid waste my vines and ruined my fig trees. It has stripped off their bark and thrown it away leaving their branches white.
Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth grieving for the husband of her youth.
Grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off from the house of the Lord. The priests are in mourning those who minister before the Lord.
The fields are ruined the ground is dried up the grain is destroyed the new wine is dried up the oil fails.
Despair you farmers wail you vine growers grieve for the wheat and the barley because the harvest of the field is destroyed.
The vine is dried up and the fig tree is withered the pomegranate the palm and the apple tree all the trees of the fieldare dried up. Surely the joy of mankind is withered away.
Put on sackcloth O priests and mourn wail you who minister before the altar. Come spend the night in sackcloth you who minister before my God for the grain offerings and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.
Declare a holy fast call a sacred assembly. Summon the elders and all who live in the land to the house of the Lord your God and cry out to the Lord.
Alas for that day! For the day of the Lord is near it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes joy and gladness from the house of our God?
The seeds are shriveled beneath the clods. The storehouses are in ruins the granaries have been broken down for the grain has dried up.
How the cattle moan! The herds mill about because they have no pasture even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
To you O Lord I call for fire has devoured the open pastures and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.
Even the wild animals pant for you the streams of water have dried up and fire has devoured the open pastures.
Blow the trumpet in Zion sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble for the day of the Lord is coming. It is close at hand
a day of darkness and gloom a day of clouds and blackness. Like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come.
Before them fire devours behind them a flame blazes. Before them the land is like the garden of Eden behind them a desert waste nothing escapes them.
They have the appearance of horses they gallop along like cavalry.
With a noise like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops like a crackling fire consuming stubble like a mighty army drawn up for battle.
At the sight of them nations are in anguish every face turns pale.
They charge like warriors they scale walls like soldiers. They all march in line not swerving from their course.
They do not jostle each other each marches straight ahead. They plunge through defenses without breaking ranks.
They rush upon the city they run along the wall. They climb into the houses like thieves they enter through the windows.
Before them the earth shakes the sky trembles the sun and moon are darkened and the stars no longer shine.
The Lord thunders at the head of his army his forces are beyond number and mighty are those who obey his command. The day of the Lord is great it is dreadful. Who can endure it?
Even now declares the Lord return to me with all your heart with fasting and weeping and mourning.
Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God for he is gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love and he relents from sending calamity.
Who knows? He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing grain offerings and drink offerings for the Lord your God.
Blow the trumpet in Zion declare a holy fast call a sacred assembly.
Gather the people consecrate the assembly bring together the elders gather the children those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber.
Let the priests who minister before the Lord weep between the temple porch and the altar. Let them say Spare your people O Lord. Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples Where is their God? 
Then the Lord will be jealous for his land and take pity on his people.
The Lord will reply to them I am sending you grain new wine and oil enough to satisfy you fully never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations.
I will drive the northern army far from you pushing it into a parched and barren land with its front columns going into the eastern sea and those in the rear into the western sea. And its stench will go up its smell will rise. Surely he has done great things.
In those days and at that time when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem
I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will enter into judgment against them concerning my inheritance my people Israel for they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land.
They cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes they sold girls for wine that they might drink.
Now what have you against me O Tyre and Sidon and all you regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something I have done? If you are paying me back I will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done.
For you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples.
You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks that you might send them far from their homeland.
See I am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them and I will return on your own heads what you have done.
I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah and they will sell them to the Sabeans a nation far away. The Lord has spoken.
Proclaim this among the nations Prepare for war! Rouse the warriors! Let all the fighting men draw near and attack.
Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weakling say I am strong!
Come quickly all you nations from every side and assemble there. Bring down your warriors O Lord!
Let the nations be roused let them advance into the Valley of Jehoshaphat for there I will sit to judge all the nations on every side.
Swing the sickle for the harvest is ripe. Come trample the grapes for the winepress is full and the vats overflow so great is their wickedness!
Multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.
The words of Amos one of the shepherds of Tekoawhat he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.
He said The Lord roars from Zion and thunders from Jerusalem the pastures of the shepherds dry up and the top of Carmel withers.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Damascus even for four I will not turn back my wrath. Because she threshed Gilead with sledges having iron teeth
I will send fire upon the house of Hazael that will consume the fortresses of BenHadad.
I will break down the gate of Damascus I will destroy the king who is in the Valley of Aven and the one who holds the scepter in Beth Eden. The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir says the Lord.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Gaza even for four I will not turn back my wrath. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom
I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses.
I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron till the last of the Philistines is dead says the Sovereign Lord.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Tyre even for four I will not turn back my wrath. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom disregarding a treaty of brotherhood
I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Edom even for four I will not turn back my wrath. Because he pursued his brother with a sword stifling all compassion because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked
I will send fire upon Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Ammon even for four I will not turn back my wrath. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders
I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle amid violent winds on a stormy day.
Her king will go into exile he and his officials together says the Lord.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Moab even for four I will not turn back my wrath. Because he burned as if to lime the bones of Edoms king
I will send fire upon Moab that will consume the fortresses of Kerioth. Moab will go down in great tumult amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet.
I will destroy her ruler and kill all her officials with him says the Lord.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Judah even for four I will not turn back my wrath. Because they have rejected the law of the Lord and have not kept his decrees because they have been led astray by false gods the gods their ancestors followed
I will send fire upon Judah that will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem.
This is what the Lord says For three sins of Israel even for four I will not turn back my wrath. They sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.
They trample on the heads of the poor as upon the dust of the ground and deny justice to the oppressed. Father and son use the same girl and so profane my holy name.
They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. In the house of their god they drink wine taken as fines.
I destroyed the Amorite before them though he was tall as the cedars and strong as the oaks. I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.
I brought you up out of Egypt and I led you forty years in the desert to give you the land of the Amorites.
I also raised up prophets from among your sons and Nazirites from among your young men. Is this not true people of Israel? declares the Lord.
But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.
Now then I will crush you as a cart crushes when loaded with grain.
The swift will not escape the strong will not muster their strength and the warrior will not save his life.
Hear this word the Lord has spoken against you O people of Israelagainst the whole family I brought up out of Egypt
You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth therefore I will punish you for all your sins.
Do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?
Does a lion roar in the thicket when he has no prey? Does he growl in his den when he has caught nothing?
Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground where no snare has been set? Does a trap spring up from the earth when there is nothing to catch?
When a trumpet sounds in a city do not the people tremble? When disaster comes to a city has not the Lord caused it?
Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.
The lion has roared who will not fear? The Sovereign Lord has spoken who can but prophesy?
Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod and to the fortresses of Egypt Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people.
They do not know how to do right declares the Lord who hoard plunder and loot in their fortresses.
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says An enemy will overrun the land he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses.
This is what the Lord says As a shepherd saves from the lions mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear so will the Israelites be saved those who sit in Samaria on the edge of their beds and in Damascus on their couches.
Hear this word you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands Bring us some drinks!
The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his holiness The time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks the last of you with fishhooks.
You will each go straight out through breaks in the wall and you will be cast out toward Harmon declares the Lord.
Go to Bethel and sin go to Gilgal and sin yet more. Bring your sacrifices every morning your tithes every three years.
Burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings boast about them you Israelites for this is what you love to do declares the Sovereign Lord.
I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town yet you have not returned to me declares the Lord.
I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town but withheld it from another. One field had rain another had none and dried up.
People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink yet you have not returned to me declares the Lord.
Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards I struck them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees yet you have not returned to me declares the Lord.
I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps yet you have not returned to me declares the Lord.
I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire yet you have not returned to me declares the Lord.
Therefore this is what I will do to you Israel and because I will do this to you prepare to meet your God O Israel.
He who forms the mountains creates the wind and reveals his thoughts to man he who turns dawn to darkness and treads the high places of the earth the Lord God Almighty is his name.
Hear this word O house of Israel this lament I take up concerning you
Fallen is Virgin Israel never to rise again deserted in her own land with no one to lift her up.
This is what the Sovereign Lord says The city that marches out a thousand strong for Israel will have only a hundred left the town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left.
This is what the Lord says to the house of Israel Seek me and live
do not seek Bethel do not go to Gilgal do not journey to Beersheba. For Gilgal will surely go into exile and Bethel will be reduced to nothing.
Seek the Lord and live or he will sweep through the house of Joseph like a fire it will devour and Bethel will have no one to quench it.
You who turn justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground
(he who made the Pleiades and Orion who turns blackness into dawn and darkens day into night who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land the Lord is his name
he flashes destruction on the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin)
you hate the one who reproves in court and despise him who tells the truth.
You trample on the poor and force him to give you grain. Therefore though you have built stone mansions you will not live in them though you have planted lush vineyards you will not drink their wine.
For I know how many are your offenses and how great your sins. You oppress the righteous and take bribes and you deprive the poor of justice in the courts.
Therefore the prudent man keeps quiet in such times for the times are evil.
Woe to you who are complacent in Zion and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria you notable men of the foremost nation to whom the people of Israel come!
Go to Calneh and look at it go from there to great Hamath and then go down to Gath in Philistia. Are they better off than your two kingdoms? Is their land larger than yours?
You put off the evil day and bring near a reign of terror.
You lie on beds inlaid with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves.
You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments.
You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile your feasting and lounging will end.
The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himselfthe Lord God Almighty declares I abhor the pride of Jacob and detest his fortresses I will deliver up the city and everything in it.
If ten men are left in one house they too will die.
And if a relative who is to burn the bodies comes to carry them out of the house and asks anyone still hiding there Is anyone with you? and he says No then he will say Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.
For the Lord has given the command and he will smash the great house into pieces and the small house into bits.
Do horses run on the rocky crags? Does one plow there with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness
you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar and say Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?
For the Lord God Almighty declares I will stir up a nation against you O house of Israel that will oppress you all the way from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.
This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me He was preparing swarms of locusts after the kings share had been harvested and just as the second crop was coming up.
When they had stripped the land clean I cried out Sovereign Lord forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!
So the Lord relented. This will not happen the Lord said.
This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me The Sovereign Lord was calling for judgment by fire it dried up the great deep and devoured the land.
Then I cried out Sovereign Lord I beg you stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!
So the Lord relented. This will not happen either the Sovereign Lord said.
This is what he showed me The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb with a plumb line in his hand.
And the Lord asked me What do you see Amos? A plumb line I replied. Then the Lord said Look I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel I will spare them no longer.
The high places of Isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.
For this is what Amos is saying  Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will surely go into exile away from their native land. 
Then Amaziah said to Amos Get out you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.
Dont prophesy anymore at Bethel because this is the kings sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.
This is what the Sovereign Lord showed me a basket of ripe fruit.
What do you see Amos? he asked. A basket of ripe fruit I answered. Then the Lord said to me The time is ripe for my people Israel I will spare them no longer.
In that day declares the Sovereign Lord the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. Many many bodiesflung everywhere! Silence!
Hear this you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land
saying When will the New Moon be over that we may sell grain and the Sabbath be ended that we may market wheat? skimping the measure boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales
buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals selling even the sweepings with the wheat.
The Lord has sworn by the Pride of Jacob I will never forget anything they have done.
Will not the land tremble for this and all who live in it mourn? The whole land will rise like the Nile it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt.
In that day declares the Sovereign Lord I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight.
I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping. I will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day.
The days are coming declares the Sovereign Lord when I will send a famine through the land not a famine of food or a thirst for water but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.
Men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east searching for the word of the Lord but they will not find it.
In that day the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst.
They who swear by the shame of Samaria or say As surely as your god lives O Dan or As surely as the god of Beersheba lives they will fall never to rise again.
I saw the Lord standing by the altar and he said Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Bring them down on the heads of all the people those who are left I will kill with the sword. Not one will get away none will escape.
Though they dig down to the depths of the grave from there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to the heavens from there I will bring them down.
Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from me at the bottom of the sea there I will command the serpent to bite them.
Though they are driven into exile by their enemies there I will command the sword to slay them. I will fix my eyes upon them for evil and not for good.
The Lord the Lord Almighty he who touches the earth and it melts and all who live in it mourn the whole land rises like the Nile then sinks like the river of Egypt
he who builds his lofty palace in the heavens and sets its foundation on the earth who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land the Lord is his name.
Are not you Israelites the same to me as the Cushites? declares the Lord. Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?
Surely the eyes of the Sovereign Lord are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy it from the face of the earth yet I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob declares the Lord.
For I will give the command and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve and not a pebble will reach the ground.
All the sinners among my people will die by the sword all those who say Disaster will not overtake or meet us.
In that day I will restore Davids fallen tent. I will repair its broken places restore its ruins and build it as it used to be
so that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name declares the Lord who will do these things.
The days are coming declares the Lord when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman and the planter by the one treading grapes. New wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills.
I will bring back my exiled people Israel they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine they will make gardens and eat their fruit.
I will plant Israel in their own land never again to be uprooted from the land I have given them says the Lord your God.
The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Sovereign Lord says about Edom We have heard a message from the Lord An envoy was sent to the nations to say Rise and let us go against her for battle
See I will make you small among the nations you will be utterly despised.
The pride of your heart has deceived you you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights you who say to yourself Who can bring me down to the ground?
Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars from there I will bring you down declares the Lord.
If thieves came to you if robbers in the night Oh what a disaster awaits you would they not steal only as much as they wanted? If grape pickers came to you would they not leave a few grapes?
But how Esau will be ransacked his hidden treasures pillaged!
All your allies will force you to the border your friends will deceive and overpower you those who eat your bread will set a trap for you but you will not detect it.
In that day declares the Lord will I not destroy the wise men of Edom men of understanding in the mountains of Esau?
Your warriors O Teman will be terrified and everyone in Esaus mountains will be cut down in the slaughter.
Because of the violence against your brother Jacob you will be covered with shame you will be destroyed forever.
On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem you were like one of them.
You should not look down on your brother in the day of his misfortune nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction nor boast so much in the day of their trouble.
You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster nor look down on them in their calamity in the day of their disaster nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.
You should not wait at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives nor hand over their survivors in the day of their trouble.
The day of the Lord is near for all nations. As you have done it will be done to you your deeds will return upon your own head.
Just as you drank on my holy hill so all the nations will drink continually they will drink and drink and be as if they had never been.
The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai
Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me.
But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord.
Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up.
All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
The captain went to him and said How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us and we will not perish.
Then the sailors said to each other Come let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity. They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
So they asked him Tell us who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?
He answered I am a Hebrew and I worship the Lord the God of heaven who made the sea and the land.
From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.
He said In my distress I called to the Lord and he answered me. From the depths of the grave I called for help and you listened to my cry.
You hurled me into the deep into the very heart of the seas and the currents swirled about me all your waves and breakers swept over me.
I said I have been banished from your sight yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
The engulfing waters threatened me the deep surrounded me seaweed was wrapped around my head.
To the roots of the mountains I sank down the earth beneath barred me in forever. But you brought my life up from the pit O Lord my God.
When my life was ebbing away I remembered you Lord and my prayer rose to you to your holy temple.
Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs.
But I with a song of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed I will make good. Salvation comes from the Lord.
And the Lord commanded the fish and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time
Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.
Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very important citya visit required three days.
On the first day Jonah started into the city. He proclaimed Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned.
The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast and all of them from the greatest to the least put on sackcloth.
When the news reached the king of Nineveh he rose from his throne took off his royal robes covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.
Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh By the decree of the king and his nobles Do not let any man or beast herd or flock taste anything do not let them eat or drink.
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.
When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.
But Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry.
He prayed to the Lord O Lord is this not what I said when I was still at home? That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God slow to anger and abounding in love a God who relents from sending calamity.
Now O Lord take away my life for it is better for me to die than to live.
But the Lord replied Have you any right to be angry?
Jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.
Then the Lord God provided a vine and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort and Jonah was very happy about the vine.
But at dawn the next day God provided a worm which chewed the vine so that it withered.
When the sun rose God provided a scorching east wind and the sun blazed on Jonahs head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die and said It would be better for me to die than to live.
But God said to Jonah Do you have a right to be angry about the vine? I do he said. I am angry enough to die.
But the Lord said You have been concerned about this vine though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight.
But Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left and many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?
The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judahthe vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
Hear O peoples all of you listen O earth and all who are in it that the Sovereign Lord may witness against you the Lord from his holy temple.
Look! The Lord is coming from his dwelling place he comes down and treads the high places of the earth.
The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart like wax before the fire like water rushing down a slope.
All this is because of Jacobs transgression because of the sins of the house of Israel. What is Jacobs transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judahs high place? Is it not Jerusalem?
Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.
All her idols will be broken to pieces all her temple gifts will be burned with fire I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used.
Because of this I will weep and wail I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.
For her wound is incurable it has come to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people even to Jerusalem itself.
Tell it not in Gath weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah roll in the dust.
Pass on in nakedness and shame you who live in Shaphir. Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning its protection is taken from you.
Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain waiting for relief because disaster has come from the Lord even to the gate of Jerusalem.
Woe to those who plan iniquity to those who plot evil on their beds! At mornings light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.
They covet fields and seize them and houses and take them. They defraud a man of his home a fellowman of his inheritance.
Therefore the Lord says I am planning disaster against this people from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly for it will be a time of calamity.
In that day men will ridicule you they will taunt you with this mournful song We are utterly ruined my peoples possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors. 
Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the Lord to divide the land by lot.
Do not prophesy their prophets say. Do not prophesy about these things disgrace will not overtake us.
Should it be said O house of Jacob Is the Spirit of the Lord angry? Does he do such things? Do not my words do good to him whose ways are upright?
Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care like men returning from battle.
You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes. You take away my blessing from their children forever.
Get up go away! For this is not your resting place because it is defiled it is ruined beyond all remedy.
If a liar and deceiver comes and says I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer he would be just the prophet for this people!
Then I said Listen you leaders of Jacob you rulers of the house of Israel. Should you not know justice
you who hate good and love evil who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones
who eat my peoples flesh strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces who chop them up like meat for the pan like flesh for the pot?
Then they will cry out to the Lord but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.
This is what the Lord says As for the prophets who lead my people astray if one feeds them they proclaim peace if he does not they prepare to wage war against him.
Therefore night will come over you without visions and darkness without divination. The sun will set for the prophets and the day will go dark for them.
The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God.
But as for me I am filled with power with the Spirit of the Lord and with justice and might to declare to Jacob his transgression to Israel his sin.
Hear this you leaders of the house of Jacob you rulers of the house of Israel who despise justice and distort all that is right
who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with wickedness.
Her leaders judge for a bribe her priests teach for a price and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they lean upon the Lord and say Is not the Lord among us? No disaster will come upon us.
Therefore because of you Zion will be plowed like a field Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.
In the last days the mountain of the Lords temple will be established as chief among the mountains it will be raised above the hills and peoples will stream to it.
Many nations will come and say Come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths. The law will go out from Zion the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war anymore.
Every man will sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree and no one will make them afraid for the Lord Almighty has spoken.
All the nations may walk in the name of their gods we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.
In that day declares the Lord I will gather the lame I will assemble the exiles and those I have brought to grief.
I will make the lame a remnant those driven away a strong nation. The Lord will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.
As for you O watchtower of the flock O stronghold of the Daughter of Zion the former dominion will be restored to you kingship will come to the Daughter of Jerusalem.
Why do you now cry aloud have you no king? Has your counselor perished that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor?
Writhe in agony O Daughter of Zion like a woman in labor for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon there you will be rescued. There the Lord will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies.
But now many nations are gathered against you. They say Let her be defiled let our eyes gloat over Zion!
But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord they do not understand his plan he who gathers them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
Rise and thresh O Daughter of Zion for I will give you horns of iron I will give you hoofs of bronze and you will break to pieces many nations. You will devote their illgotten gains to the Lord their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
Marshal your troops O city of troops for a siege is laid against us. They will strike Israels ruler on the cheek with a rod.
But you Bethlehem Ephrathah though you are small among the clans of Judah out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel whose origins are from of old from ancient times.
Therefore Israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor gives birth and the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites.
He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. And they will live securely for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth.
And he will be their peace. When the Assyrian invades our land and marches through our fortresses we will raise against him seven shepherds even eight leaders of men.
They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword the land of Nimrod with drawn sword. He will deliver us from the Assyrian when he invades our land and marches into our borders.
The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the Lord like showers on the grass which do not wait for man or linger for mankind.
The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations in the midst of many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest like a young lion among flocks of sheep which mauls and mangles as it goes and no one can rescue.
Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies and all your foes will be destroyed.
In that day declares the Lord I will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots.
I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds.
I will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells.
I will destroy your carved images and your sacred stones from among you you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.
I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles and demolish your cities.
I will take vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations that have not obeyed me.
Listen to what the Lord says Stand up plead your case before the mountains let the hills hear what you have to say.
Hear O mountains the Lords accusation listen you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the Lord has a case against his people he is lodging a charge against Israel.
My people what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me.
I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you also Aaron and Miriam.
My people remember what Balak king of Moab counseled and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.
With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings with calves a year old?
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
He has showed you O man what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
Listen! The Lord is calling to the city and to fear your name is wisdom Heed the rod and the One who appointed it.
Am I still to forget O wicked house your illgotten treasures and the short ephah which is accursed?
Shall I acquit a man with dishonest scales with a bag of false weights?
Her rich men are violent her people are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully.
Therefore I have begun to destroy you to ruin you because of your sins.
You will eat but not be satisfied your stomach will still be empty. You will store up but save nothing because what you save I will give to the sword.
You will plant but not harvest you will press olives but not use the oil on yourselves you will crush grapes but not drink the wine.
You have observed the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahabs house and you have followed their traditions. Therefore I will give you over to ruin and your people to derision you will bear the scorn of the nations.
What misery is mine! I am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard there is no cluster of grapes to eat none of the early figs that I crave.
The godly have been swept from the land not one upright man remains. All men lie in wait to shed blood each hunts his brother with a net.
Both hands are skilled in doing evil the ruler demands gifts the judge accepts bribes the powerful dictate what they desire they all conspire together.
The best of them is like a brier the most upright worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen has come the day God visits you. Now is the time of their confusion.
Do not trust a neighbor put no confidence in a friend. Even with her who lies in your embrace be careful of your words.
For a son dishonors his father a daughter rises up against her mother a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw a mans enemies are the members of his own household.
But as for me I watch in hope for the Lord I wait for God my Savior my God will hear me.
Do not gloat over me my enemy! Though I have fallen I will rise. Though I sit in darkness the Lord will be my light.
Because I have sinned against him I will bear the Lords wrath until he pleads my case and establishes my right. He will bring me out into the light I will see his righteousness.
Then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame she who said to me Where is the Lord your God? My eyes will see her downfall even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets.
The day for building your walls will come the day for extending your boundaries.
In that day people will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants as the result of their deeds.
Shepherd your people with your staff the flock of your inheritance which lives by itself in a forest in fertile pasturelands. Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago.
An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
The Lord is a jealous and avenging God the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies.
The Lord is slow to anger and great in power the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm and clouds are the dust of his feet.
He rebukes the sea and dries it up he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.
The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away. The earth trembles at his presence the world and all who live in it.
Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire the rocks are shattered before him.
The Lord is good a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him
but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh he will pursue his foes into darkness.
Whatever they plot against the Lord he will bring to an end trouble will not come a second time.
They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine they will be consumed like dry stubble.
From you O Nineveh has one come forth who plots evil against the Lord and counsels wickedness.
This is what the Lord says Although they have allies and are numerous they will be cut off and pass away. Although I have afflicted you O Judah I will afflict you no more.
An attacker advances against you Nineveh. Guard the fortress watch the road brace yourselves marshal all your strength!
The Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines.
The shields of his soldiers are red the warriors are clad in scarlet. The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready the spears of pine are brandished.
The chariots storm through the streets rushing back and forth through the squares. They look like flaming torches they dart about like lightning.
He summons his picked troops yet they stumble on their way. They dash to the city wall the protective shield is put in place.
The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.
It is decreed that the city be exiled and carried away. Its slave girls moan like doves and beat upon their breasts.
Nineveh is like a pool and its water is draining away. Stop! Stop! they cry but no one turns back.
Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The supply is endless the wealth from all its treasures!
She is pillaged plundered stripped! Hearts melt knees give way bodies tremble every face grows pale.
Where now is the lions den the place where they fed their young where the lion and lioness went and the cubs with nothing to fear?
The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey.
I am against you declares the Lord Almighty. I will burn up your chariots in smoke and the sword will devour your young lions. I will leave you no prey on the earth. The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.
Woe to the city of blood full of lies full of plunder never without victims!
The crack of whips the clatter of wheels galloping horses and jolting chariots!
Charging cavalry flashing swords and glittering spears! Many casualties piles of dead bodies without number people stumbling over the corpses
all because of the wanton lust of a harlot alluring the mistress of sorceries who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.
I am against you declares the Lord Almighty. I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.
I will pelt you with filth I will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle.
All who see you will flee from you and say Nineveh is in ruinswho will mourn for her? Where can I find anyone to comfort you?
Are you better than Thebes situated on the Nile with water around her? The river was her defense the waters her wall.
Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength Put and Libya were among her allies.
Yet she was taken captive and went into exile. Her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. Lots were cast for her nobles and all her great men were put in chains.
You too will become drunk you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.
All your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit when they are shaken the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.
Look at your troops they are all women! The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies fire has consumed their bars.
Draw water for the siege strengthen your defenses! Work the clay tread the mortar repair the brickwork!
There the fire will devour you the sword will cut you down and like grasshoppers consume you. Multiply like grasshoppers multiply like locusts!
You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more than the stars of the sky but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away.
The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet received.
How long O Lord must I call for help but you do not listen? Or cry out to you Violence! but you do not save?
Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me there is strife and conflict abounds.
Therefore the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteous so that justice is perverted.
Look at the nations and watch and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe even if you were told.
I am raising up the Babylonians that ruthless and impetuous people who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own.
They are a feared and dreaded people they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor.
Their horses are swifter than leopards fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their cavalry gallops headlong their horsemen come from afar. They fly like a vulture swooping to devour
they all come bent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand.
They deride kings and scoff at rulers. They laugh at all fortified cities they build earthen ramps and capture them.
Then they sweep past like the wind and go on guilty men whose own strength is their god.
O Lord are you not from everlasting? My God my Holy One we will not die. O Lord you have appointed them to execute judgment O Rock you have ordained them to punish.
Your eyes are too pure to look on evil you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
You have made men like fish in the sea like sea creatures that have no ruler.
The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks he catches them in his net he gathers them up in his dragnet and so he rejoices and is glad.
Therefore he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet for by his net he lives in luxury and enjoys the choicest food.
Is he to keep on emptying his net destroying nations without mercy?
I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts I will look to see what he will say to me and what answer I am to give to this complaint.
Then the Lord replied Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it.
For the revelation awaits an appointed time it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger wait for it it will certainly come and will not delay.
See he is puffed up his desires are not upright but the righteous will live by his faith
indeed wine betrays him he is arrogant and never at rest. Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.
Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn saying  Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion! How long must this go on?
Will not your debtors suddenly arise? Will they not wake up and make you tremble? Then you will become their victim.
Because you have plundered many nations the peoples who are left will plunder you. For you have shed mans blood you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
Woe to him who builds his realm by unjust gain to set his nest on high to escape the clutches of ruin!
You have plotted the ruin of many peoples shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.
The stones of the wall will cry out and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.
Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by crime!
Has not the Lord Almighty determined that the peoples labor is only fuel for the fire that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?
For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk so that he can gaze on their naked bodies.
You will be filled with shame instead of glory. Now it is your turn! Drink and be exposed! The cup from the Lords right hand is coming around to you and disgrace will cover your glory.
The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you and your destruction of animals will terrify you. For you have shed mans blood you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them.
Of what value is an idol since a man has carved it? Or an image that teaches lies? For he who makes it trusts in his own creation he makes idols that cannot speak.
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet. On shigionoth.
Lord I have heard of your fame I stand in awe of your deeds O Lord. Renew them in our day in our time make them known in wrath remember mercy.
God came from Teman the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His glory covered the heavens and his praise filled the earth.
His splendor was like the sunrise rays flashed from his hand where his power was hidden.
Plague went before him pestilence followed his steps.
He stood and shook the earth he looked and made the nations tremble. The ancient mountains crumbled and the ageold hills collapsed. His ways are eternal.
I saw the tents of Cushan in distress the dwellings of Midian in anguish.
Were you angry with the rivers O Lord? Was your wrath against the streams? Did you rage against the sea when you rode with your horses and your victorious chariots?
You uncovered your bow you called for many arrows. Selah You split the earth with rivers
the mountains saw you and writhed. Torrents of water swept by the deep roared and lifted its waves on high.
Sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows at the lightning of your flashing spear.
In wrath you strode through the earth and in anger you threshed the nations.
You came out to deliver your people to save your anointed one. You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness you stripped him from head to foot. Selah
With his own spear you pierced his head when his warriors stormed out to scatter us gloating as though about to devour the wretched who were in hiding.
You trampled the sea with your horses churning the great waters.
I heard and my heart pounded my lips quivered at the sound decay crept into my bones and my legs trembled. Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us.
Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls
The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi the son of Gedaliah the son of Amariah the son of Hezekiah during the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah
I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth declares the Lord.
I will sweep away both men and animals I will sweep away the birds of the air and the fish of the sea. The wicked will have only heaps of rubble when I cut off man from the face of the earth declares the Lord.
I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal the names of the pagan and the idolatrous priests
those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host those who bow down and swear by the Lord and who also swear by Molech
those who turn back from following the Lord and neither seek the Lord nor inquire of him.
Be silent before the Sovereign Lord for the day of the Lord is near. The Lord has prepared a sacrifice he has consecrated those he has invited.
On the day of the Lords sacrifice I will punish the princes and the kings sons and all those clad in foreign clothes.
On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit.
On that day declares the Lord a cry will go up from the Fish Gate wailing from the New Quarter and a loud crash from the hills.
Wail you who live in the market district all your merchants will be wiped out all who trade with silver will be ruined.
At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent who are like wine left on its dregs who think The Lord will do nothing either good or bad.
Their wealth will be plundered their houses demolished. They will build houses but not live in them they will plant vineyards but not drink the wine.
The great day of the Lord is near near and coming quickly. Listen! The cry on the day of the Lord will be bitter the shouting of the warrior there.
Gather together gather together O shameful nation
before the appointed time arrives and that day sweeps on like chaff before the fierce anger of the Lord comes upon you before the day of the Lords wrath comes upon you.
Seek the Lord all you humble of the land you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness seek humility perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lords anger.
Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted.
Woe to you who live by the sea O Kerethite people the word of the Lord is against you O Canaan land of the Philistines. I will destroy you and none will be left.
The land by the sea where the Kerethites dwell will be a place for shepherds and sheep pens.
It will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah there they will find pasture. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. The Lord their God will care for them he will restore their fortunes.
I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites who insulted my people and made threats against their land.
Therefore as surely as I live declares the Lord Almighty the God of Israel surely Moab will become like Sodom the Ammonites like Gomorrah a place of weeds and salt pits a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.
This is what they will get in return for their pride for insulting and mocking the people of the Lord Almighty.
The Lord will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the land. The nations on every shore will worship him every one in its own land.
You too O Cushites will be slain by my sword.
He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert.
Flocks and herds will lie down there creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their calls will echo through the windows rubble will be in the doorways the beams of cedar will be exposed.
This is the carefree city that lived in safety. She said to herself I am and there is none besides me. What a ruin she has become a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.
Woe to the city of oppressors rebellious and defiled!
She obeys no one she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the Lord she does not draw near to her God.
Her officials are roaring lions her rulers are evening wolves who leave nothing for the morning.
Her prophets are arrogant they are treacherous men. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law.
The Lord within her is righteous he does no wrong. Morning by morning he dispenses his justice and every new day he does not fail yet the unrighteous know no shame.
I have cut off nations their strongholds are demolished. I have left their streets deserted with no one passing through. Their cities are destroyed no one will be leftno one at all.
I said to the city Surely you will fear me and accept correction! Then her dwelling would not be cut off nor all my punishments come upon her. But they were still eager to act corruptly in all they did.
Therefore wait for me declares the Lord for the day I will stand up to testify. I have decided to assemble the nations to gather the kingdoms and to pour out my wrath on them all my fierce anger. The whole world will be consumed by the fire of my jealous anger.
Then will I purify the lips of the peoples that all of them may call on the name of the Lord and serve him shoulder to shoulder.
From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers my scattered people will bring me offerings.
On that day you will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me because I will remove from this city those who rejoice in their pride. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill.
But I will leave within you the meek and humble who trust in the name of the Lord.
The remnant of Israel will do no wrong they will speak no lies nor will deceit be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down and no one will make them afraid.
Sing O Daughter of Zion shout aloud O Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart O Daughter of Jerusalem!
In the second year of King Darius on the first day of the sixth month the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest
This is what the Lord Almighty says These people say The time has not yet come for the Lords house to be built. 
Then the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai
Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses while this house remains a ruin?
Now this is what the Lord Almighty says Give careful thought to your ways.
You have planted much but have harvested little. You eat but never have enough. You drink but never have your fill. You put on clothes but are not warm. You earn wages only to put them in a purse with holes in it.
This is what the Lord Almighty says Give careful thought to your ways.
Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored says the Lord.
You expected much but see it turned out to be little. What you brought home I blew away. Why? declares the Lord Almighty. Because of my house which remains a ruin while each of you is busy with his own house.
Therefore because of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth its crops.
I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains on the grain the new wine the oil and whatever the ground produces on men and cattle and on the labor of your hands.
Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the message of the prophet Haggai because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord.
Then Haggai the Lords messenger gave this message of the Lord to the people I am with you declares the Lord.
So the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of the Lord Almighty their God
on the twentyfourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius.
On the twentyfirst day of the seventh month the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai
Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah to Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and to the remnant of the people. Ask them
Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing?
But now be strong O Zerubbabel declares the Lord. Be strong O Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest. Be strong all you people of the land declares the Lord and work. For I am with you declares the Lord Almighty.
This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.
This is what the Lord Almighty says In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth the sea and the dry land.
I will shake all nations and the desired of all nations will come and I will fill this house with glory says the Lord Almighty.
The silver is mine and the gold is mine declares the Lord Almighty.
The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house says the Lord Almighty. And in this place I will grant peace declares the Lord Almighty.
On the twentyfourth day of the ninth month in the second year of Darius the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai
This is what the Lord Almighty says Ask the priests what the law says
If a person carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment and that fold touches some bread or stew some wine oil or other food does it become consecrated?  The priests answered No.
Then Haggai said If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things does it become defiled? Yes the priests replied it becomes defiled.
Then Haggai said  So it is with this people and this nation in my sight declares the Lord. Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.
 Now give careful thought to this from this day on consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the Lords temple.
When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures there were only twenty.
I struck all the work of your hands with blight mildew and hail yet you did not turn to me declares the Lord.
From this day on from this twentyfourth day of the ninth month give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lords temple was laid. Give careful thought
Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now the vine and the fig tree the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit.  From this day on I will bless you. 
The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twentyfourth day of the month
In the eighth month of the second year of Darius the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah the son of Iddo
The Lord was very angry with your forefathers.
Therefore tell the people This is what the Lord Almighty says Return to me declares the Lord Almighty and I will return to you says the Lord Almighty.
Do not be like your forefathers to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed This is what the Lord Almighty says Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices. But they would not listen or pay attention to me declares the Lord.
Where are your forefathers now? And the prophets do they live forever?
But did not my words and my decrees which I commanded my servants the prophets overtake your forefathers? Then they repented and said The Lord Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve just as he determined to do. 
On the twentyfourth day of the eleventh month the month of Shebat in the second year of Darius the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah the son of Iddo.
During the night I had a visionand there before me was a man riding a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red brown and white horses.
I asked What are these my lord? The angel who was talking with me answered I will show you what they are.
Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained They are the ones the Lord has sent to go throughout the earth.
And they reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.
Then the angel of the Lord said  Lord Almighty how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah which you have been angry with these seventy years?
Then I looked upand there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand!
I asked Where are you going? He answered me To measure Jerusalem to find out how wide and how long it is.
Then the angel who was speaking to me left and another angel came to meet him
and said to him Run tell that young man Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of men and livestock in it.
And I myself will be a wall of fire around it declares the Lord and I will be its glory within.
Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north declares the Lord for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven declares the Lord.
Come O Zion! Escape you who live in the Daughter of Babylon!
For this is what the Lord Almighty says After he has honored me and has sent me against the nations that have plundered youfor whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye
I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.
Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.
The Lord said to Satan The Lord rebuke you Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?
Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
The angel said to those who were standing before him Take off his filthy clothes. Then he said to Joshua See I have taken away your sin and I will put rich garments on you.
Then I said Put a clean turban on his head. So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him while the angel of the Lord stood by.
The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua
This is what the Lord Almighty says If you will walk in my ways and keep my requirements then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts and I will give you a place among these standing here.
 Listen O high priest Joshua and your associates seated before you who are men symbolic of things to come I am going to bring my servant the Branch.
See the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone and I will engrave an inscription on it says the Lord Almighty and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.
 In that day each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree declares the Lord Almighty.
Then the angel who talked with me returned and wakened me as a man is wakened from his sleep.
He asked me What do you see? I answered I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lights on it with seven channels to the lights.
Also there are two olive trees by it one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.
I asked the angel who talked with me What are these my lord?
He answered Do you not know what these are? No my lord I replied.
So he said to me This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel Not by might nor by power but by my Spirit says the Lord Almighty.
What are you O mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of God bless it! God bless it! 
Then the word of the Lord came to me
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
Who despises the day of small things? Men will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. 
I looked againand there before me was a flying scroll!
He asked me What do you see? I answered I see a flying scroll thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.
And he said to me This is the curse that is going out over the whole land for according to what it says on one side every thief will be banished and according to what it says on the other everyone who swears falsely will be banished.
The Lord Almighty declares I will send it out and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in his house and destroy it both its timbers and its stones. 
Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me Look up and see what this is that is appearing.
I asked What is it? He replied It is a measuring basket. And he added This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land.
Then the cover of lead was raised and there in the basket sat a woman!
He said This is wickedness and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed the lead cover down over its mouth.
Then I looked upand there before me were two women with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
Where are they taking the basket? I asked the angel who was speaking to me.
He replied To the country of Babylonia to build a house for it. When it is ready the basket will be set there in its place.
I looked up againand there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountainsmountains of bronze!
The first chariot had red horses the second black
the third white and the fourth dappledall of them powerful.
I asked the angel who was speaking to me What are these my lord?
The angel answered me These are the four spirits of heaven going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world.
The one with the black horses is going toward the north country the one with the white horses toward the west and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.
When the powerful horses went out they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said Go throughout the earth! So they went throughout the earth.
Then he called to me Look those going toward the north country have given my Spirit rest in the land of the north.
The word of the Lord came to me
Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai Tobijah and Jedaiah who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
Take the silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak.
Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty says Here is the man whose name is the Branch and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord.
It is he who will build the temple of the Lord and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.
In the fourth year of King Darius the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month the month of Kislev.
The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and RegemMelech together with their men to entreat the Lord
by asking the priests of the house of the Lord Almighty and the prophets Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month as I have done for so many years?
Then the word of the Lord Almighty came to me
Ask all the people of the land and the priests When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years was it really for me that you fasted?
And when you were eating and drinking were you not just feasting for yourselves?
Are these not the words the Lord proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous and the Negev and the western foothills were settled? 
And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah
This is what the Lord Almighty says Administer true justice show mercy and compassion to one another.
Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless the alien or the poor. In your hearts do not think evil of each other.
But they refused to pay attention stubbornly they turned their backs and stopped up their ears.
They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry.
 When I called they did not listen so when they called I would not listen says the Lord Almighty.
I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations where they were strangers. The land was left so desolate behind them that no one could come or go. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate. 
Again the word of the Lord Almighty came to me.
This is what the Lord Almighty says I am very jealous for Zion I am burning with jealousy for her.
This is what the Lord says I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth and the mountain of the Lord Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.
This is what the Lord Almighty says Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem each with cane in hand because of his age.
The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.
This is what the Lord Almighty says It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time but will it seem marvelous to me? declares the Lord Almighty.
This is what the Lord Almighty says I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west.
I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem they will be my people and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.
This is what the Lord Almighty says You who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were there when the foundation was laid for the house of the Lord Almighty let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.
Before that time there were no wages for man or beast. No one could go about his business safely because of his enemy for I had turned every man against his neighbor.
But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past declares the Lord Almighty.
The seed will grow well the vine will yield its fruit the ground will produce its crops and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.
As you have been an object of cursing among the nations O Judah and Israel so will I save you and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid but let your hands be strong.
This is what the Lord Almighty says Just as I had determined to bring disaster upon you and showed no pity when your fathers angered me says the Lord Almighty
so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.
These are the things you are to do Speak the truth to each other and render true and sound judgment in your courts
The word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach and will rest upon Damascus for the eyes of men and all the tribes of Israel are on the Lord
and upon Hamath too which borders on it and upon Tyre and Sidon though they are very skillful.
Tyre has built herself a stronghold she has heaped up silver like dust and gold like the dirt of the streets.
But the Lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea and she will be consumed by fire.
Ashkelon will see it and fear Gaza will writhe in agony and Ekron too for her hope will wither. Gaza will lose her king and Ashkelon will be deserted.
Foreigners will occupy Ashdod and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
I will take the blood from their mouths the forbidden food from between their teeth. Those who are left will belong to our God and become leaders in Judah and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
But I will defend my house against marauding forces. Never again will an oppressor overrun my people for now I am keeping watch.
Rejoice greatly O Daughter of Zion! Shout Daughter of Jerusalem! See your king comes to you righteous and having salvation gentle and riding on a donkey on a colt the foal of a donkey.
I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
As for you because of the blood of my covenant with you I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
Ask the Lord for rain in the springtime it is the Lord who makes the storm clouds. He gives showers of rain to men and plants of the field to everyone.
The idols speak deceit diviners see visions that lie they tell dreams that are false they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd.
My anger burns against the shepherds and I will punish the leaders for the Lord Almighty will care for his flock the house of Judah and make them like a proud horse in battle.
From Judah will come the cornerstone from him the tent peg from him the battle bow from him every ruler.
Together they will be like mighty men trampling the muddy streets in battle. Because the Lord is with them they will fight and overthrow the horsemen.
I will strengthen the house of Judah and save the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them for I am the Lord their God and I will answer them.
The Ephraimites will become like mighty men and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful their hearts will rejoice in the Lord.
I will signal for them and gather them in. Surely I will redeem them they will be as numerous as before.
Though I scatter them among the peoples yet in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive and they will return.
I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon and there will not be room enough for them.
They will pass through the sea of trouble the surging sea will be subdued and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyrias pride will be brought down and Egypts scepter will pass away.
I will strengthen them in the Lord and in his name they will walk declares the Lord.
Open your doors O Lebanon so that fire may devour your cedars!
Wail O pine tree for the cedar has fallen the stately trees are ruined! Wail oaks of Bashan the dense forest has been cut down!
Listen to the wail of the shepherds their rich pastures are destroyed! Listen to the roar of the lions the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined!
This is what the Lord my God says Pasture the flock marked for slaughter.
Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say Praise the Lord I am rich! Their own shepherds do not spare them.
For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land declares the Lord. I will hand everyone over to his neighbor and his king. They will oppress the land and I will not rescue them from their hands.
So I pastured the flock marked for slaughter particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union and I pastured the flock.
In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me and I grew weary of them
and said I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one anothers flesh.
Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations.
It was revoked on that day and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the Lord.
This is the word of the Lord concerning Israel. The Lord who stretches out the heavens who lays the foundation of the earth and who forms the spirit of man within him declares
I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem.
On that day when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves.
On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness declares the Lord. I will keep a watchful eye over the house of Judah but I will blind all the horses of the nations.
Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts The people of Jerusalem are strong because the Lord Almighty is their God.
On that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume right and left all the surrounding peoples but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.
The Lord will save the dwellings of Judah first so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalems inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah.
On that day the Lord will shield those who live in Jerusalem so that the feeblest among them will be like David and the house of David will be like God like the Angel of the Lord going before them.
On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
On that day I will banish the names of the idols from the land and they will be remembered no more declares the Lord Almighty. I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.
And if anyone still prophesies his father and mother to whom he was born will say to him You must die because you have told lies in the Lords name. When he prophesies his own parents will stab him.
On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his prophetic vision. He will not put on a prophets garment of hair in order to deceive.
He will say I am not a prophet. I am a farmer the land has been my livelihood since my youth.
If someone asks him What are these wounds on your body? he will answer The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.
Awake O sword against my shepherd against the man who is close to me! declares the Lord Almighty. Strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
In the whole land declares the Lord twothirds will be struck down and perish yet onethird will be left in it.
This third I will bring into the fire I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them I will say They are my people and they will say The Lord is our God. 
A day of the Lord is coming when your plunder will be divided among you.
I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it the city will be captured the houses ransacked and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.
Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations as he fights in the day of battle.
On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west forming a great valley with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.
You will flee by my mountain valley for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come and all the holy ones with him.
On that day there will be no light no cold or frost.
It will be a unique day without daytime or nighttimea day known to the Lord. When evening comes there will be light.
On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea in summer and in winter.
The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one Lord and his name the only name.
The whole land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up and remain in its place from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate to the Corner Gate and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.
It will be inhabited never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.
This is the plague with which the Lord will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet their eyes will rot in their sockets and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
On that day men will be stricken by the Lord with great panic. Each man will seize the hand of another and they will attack each other.
An oracle The word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi.
I have loved you says the Lord. But you ask How have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacobs brother? the Lord says. Yet I have loved Jacob
but Esau I have hated and I have turned his mountains into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.
Edom may say Though we have been crushed we will rebuild the ruins. But this is what the Lord Almighty says They may build but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land a people always under the wrath of the Lord.
You will see it with your own eyes and say Great is the Lordeven beyond the borders of Israel!
A son honors his father and a servant his master. If I am a father where is the honor due me? If I am a master where is the respect due me? says the Lord Almighty. It is you O priests who show contempt for my name. But you ask How have we shown contempt for your name?
You place defiled food on my altar. But you ask How have we defiled you? By saying that the Lords table is contemptible.
When you bring blind animals for sacrifice is that not wrong? When you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you? says the Lord Almighty.
Now implore God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands will he accept you?says the Lord Almighty.
Oh that one of you would shut the temple doors so that you would not light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you says the Lord Almighty and I will accept no offering from your hands.
My name will be great among the nations from the rising to the setting of the sun. In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name because my name will be great among the nations says the Lord Almighty.
But you profane it by saying of the Lords table It is defiled and of its food It is contemptible.
And you say What a burden! and you sniff at it contemptuously says the Lord Almighty. When you bring injured crippled or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices should I accept them from your hands? says the Lord.
Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king says the Lord Almighty and my name is to be feared among the nations.
And now this admonition is for you O priests.
If you do not listen and if you do not set your heart to honor my name says the Lord Almighty I will send a curse upon you and I will curse your blessings. Yes I have already cursed them because you have not set your heart to honor me.
Because of you I will rebuke your descendants I will spread on your faces the offal from your festival sacrifices and you will be carried off with it.
And you will know that I have sent you this admonition so that my covenant with Levi may continue says the Lord Almighty.
My covenant was with him a covenant of life and peace and I gave them to him this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name.
True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness and turned many from sin.
For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge and from his mouth men should seek instructionbecause he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.
But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble you have violated the covenant with Levi says the Lord Almighty.
So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.
Have we not all one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers by breaking faith with one another?
Judah has broken faith. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.
As for the man who does this whoever he may be may the Lord cut him off from the tents of Jacob even though he brings offerings to the Lord Almighty.
Another thing you do You flood the Lords altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer pays attention to your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands.
You ask Why? It is because the Lord is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth because you have broken faith with her though she is your partner the wife of your marriage covenant.
Has not the Lord made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why one? Because he was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.
I hate divorce says the Lord God of Israel and I hate a mans covering himself with violence as well as with his garment says the Lord Almighty. So guard yourself in your spirit and do not break faith.
You have wearied the Lord with your words. How have we wearied him? you ask. By saying All who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord and he is pleased with them or Where is the God of justice?
See I will send my messenger who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple the messenger of the covenant whom you desire will come says the Lord Almighty.
But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiners fire or a launderers soap.
He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the Lord will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness
and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the Lord as in days gone by as in former years.
So I will come near to you for judgment. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers adulterers and perjurers against those who defraud laborers of their wages who oppress the widows and the fatherless and deprive aliens of justice but do not fear me says the Lord Almighty.
Surely the day is coming it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble and that day that is coming will set them on fire says the Lord Almighty. Not a root or a branch will be left to them.
But for you who revere my name the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall.
Then you will trample down the wicked they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I do these things says the Lord Almighty.
Remember the law of my servant Moses the decrees and laws I gave him at Horeb for all Israel.
See I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes.
He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers or else I will come and strike the land with a curse.
A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham
Abraham was the father of Isaac Isaac the father of Jacob Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers
Judah the father of Perez and Zerah whose mother was Tamar Perez the father of Hezron Hezron the father of Ram
Ram the father of Amminadab Amminadab the father of Nahshon Nahshon the father of Salmon
Salmon the father of Boaz whose mother was Rahab Boaz the father of Obed whose mother was Ruth Obed the father of Jesse
and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon whose mother had been Uriahs wife
Solomon the father of Rehoboam Rehoboam the father of Abijah Abijah the father of Asa
Asa the father of Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram Jehoram the father of Uzziah
Uzziah the father of Jotham Jotham the father of Ahaz Ahaz the father of Hezekiah
Hezekiah the father of Manasseh Manasseh the father of Amon Amon the father of Josiah
and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
After the exile to Babylon Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel
Zerubbabel the father of Abiud Abiud the father of Eliakim Eliakim the father of Azor
Azor the father of Zadok Zadok the father of Akim Akim the father of Eliud
Eliud the father of Eleazar Eleazar the father of Matthan Matthan the father of Jacob
and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.
Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph but before they came together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
But after he had considered this an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said Joseph son of David do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus because he will save his people from their sins.
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
and asked Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.
When King Herod heard this he was disturbed and all Jerusalem with him.
When he had called together all the peoples chief priests and teachers of the law he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
In Bethlehem in Judea they replied for this is what the prophet has written
 But you Bethlehem in the land of Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel. 
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him report to me so that I too may go and worship him.
After they had heard the king they went on their way and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star they were overjoyed.
On coming to the house they saw the child with his mother Mary and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.
And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod they returned to their country by another route.
When they had gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. Get up he said take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.
So he got up took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt
where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet Out of Egypt I called my son.
When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi he was furious and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the Desert of Judea
and saying Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near.
This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah A voice of one calling in the desert Prepare the way for the Lord make straight paths for him. 
Johns clothes were made of camels hair and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.
Confessing their sins they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing he said to them You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
And do not think you can say to yourselves We have Abraham as our father. I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The ax is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
His winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John tried to deter him saying I need to be baptized by you and do you come to me?
Jesus replied Let it be so now it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness. Then John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
And a voice from heaven said This is my Son whom I love with him I am well pleased.
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting forty days and forty nights he was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said If you are the Son of God tell these stones to become bread.
Jesus answered It is written Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God. 
Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
If you are the Son of God he said throw yourself down. For it is written  He will command his angels concerning you and they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 
Jesus answered him It is also written Do not put the Lord your God to the test. 
Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
All this I will give you he said if you will bow down and worship me.
Jesus said to him Away from me Satan! For it is written Worship the Lord your God and serve him only. 
Then the devil left him and angels came and attended him.
When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison he returned to Galilee.
Leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali
to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah
Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali the way to the sea along the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles
the people living in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.
From that time on Jesus began to preach Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near.
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake for they were fishermen.
Come follow me Jesus said and I will make you fishers of men.
At once they left their nets and followed him.
Going on from there he saw two other brothers James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee preparing their nets. Jesus called them
and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
Jesus went throughout Galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
News about him spread all over Syria and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases those suffering severe pain the demonpossessed those having seizures and the paralyzed and he healed them.
Large crowds from Galilee the Decapolis Jerusalem Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.
Now when he saw the crowds he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him
and he began to teach them saying
Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men.
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
I tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
You have heard that it was said to the people long ago Do not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again anyone who says to his brother Raca  is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says You fool! will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you
leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother then come and offer your gift.
Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way or he may hand you over to the judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into prison.
I tell you the truth you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.
You have heard that it was said Do not commit adultery.
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.
It has been said Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness causes her to become an adulteress and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.
Again you have heard that it was said to the people long ago Do not break your oath but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.
Be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them. If you do you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
So when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men. I tell you the truth they have received their reward in full.
But when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
And when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth they have received their reward in full.
But when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
And when you pray do not keep on babbling like pagans for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
Do not be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
This then is how you should pray  Our Father in heaven hallowed be your name
your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one.
For if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive men their sins your Father will not forgive your sins.
When you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth they have received their reward in full.
But when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face
so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting but only to your Father who is unseen and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.
For where your treasure is there your heart will be also.
The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eyes are bad your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear. Is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes?
Look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.
Do not judge or you too will be judged.
For in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
How can you say to your brother Let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?
You hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye.
Do not give dogs what is sacred do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you to pieces.
Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened.
Which of you if his son asks for bread will give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake?
If you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!
So in everything do to others what you would have them do to you for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it.
But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it.
Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
Likewise every good tree bears good fruit but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Thus by their fruit you will recognize them.
Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?
Then I will tell them plainly I never knew you. Away from me you evildoers!
Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock.
But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash.
When Jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were amazed at his teaching
because he taught as one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law.
When he came down from the mountainside large crowds followed him.
A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said Lord if you are willing you can make me clean.
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. I am willing he said. Be clean! Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him See that you dont tell anyone. But go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them.
When Jesus had entered Capernaum a centurion came to him asking for help.
Lord he said my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering.
Jesus said to him I will go and heal him.
The centurion replied Lord I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word and my servant will be healed.
For I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me. I tell this one Go and he goes and that one Come and he comes. I say to my servant Do this and he does it.
When Jesus heard this he was astonished and said to those following him I tell you the truth I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will take their places at the feast with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion Go! It will be done just as you believed it would. And his servant was healed at that very hour.
When Jesus came into Peters house he saw Peters motherinlaw lying in bed with a fever.
He touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began to wait on him.
When evening came many who were demonpossessed were brought to him and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.
When Jesus saw the crowd around him he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said Teacher I will follow you wherever you go.
Jesus replied Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.
Another disciple said to him Lord first let me go and bury my father.
But Jesus told him Follow me and let the dead bury their own dead.
Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.
Without warning a furious storm came up on the lake so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The disciples went and woke him saying Lord save us! Were going to drown!
He replied You of little faith why are you so afraid? Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves and it was completely calm.
The men were amazed and asked What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!
When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes two demonpossessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
What do you want with us Son of God? they shouted. Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?
Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus If you drive us out send us into the herd of pigs.
He said to them Go! So they came out and went into the pigs and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.
Those tending the pigs ran off went into the town and reported all this including what had happened to the demonpossessed men.
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him they pleaded with him to leave their region.
Jesus stepped into a boat crossed over and came to his own town.
Some men brought to him a paralytic lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic Take heart son your sins are forgiven.
At this some of the teachers of the law said to themselves This fellow is blaspheming!
Knowing their thoughts Jesus said Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?
Which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and walk?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.... Then he said to the paralytic Get up take your mat and go home.
And the man got up and went home.
When the crowd saw this they were filled with awe and they praised God who had given such authority to men.
As Jesus went on from there he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collectors booth. Follow me he told him and Matthew got up and followed him.
While Jesus was having dinner at Matthews house many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this they asked his disciples Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
On hearing this Jesus said It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.
But go and learn what this means I desire mercy not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous but sinners.
Then Johns disciples came and asked him How is it that we and the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast?
Jesus answered How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them then they will fast.
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment for the patch will pull away from the garment making the tear worse.
Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do the skins will burst the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No they pour new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.
While he was saying this a ruler came and knelt before him and said My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her and she will live.
Jesus got up and went with him and so did his disciples.
Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
She said to herself If I only touch his cloak I will be healed.
Jesus turned and saw her. Take heart daughter he said your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that moment.
When Jesus entered the rulers house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd
he said Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep. But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been put outside he went in and took the girl by the hand and she got up.
News of this spread through all that region.
As Jesus went on from there two blind men followed him calling out Have mercy on us Son of David!
When he had gone indoors the blind men came to him and he asked them Do you believe that I am able to do this? Yes Lord they replied.
Then he touched their eyes and said According to your faith will it be done to you
and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly See that no one knows about this.
But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.
While they were going out a man who was demonpossessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus.
And when the demon was driven out the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.
But the Pharisees said It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.
Jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.
Ask the Lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field.
He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles first Simon  and his brother Andrew James son of Zebedee and his brother John
Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the tax collector James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus
Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
As you go preach this message The kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick raise the dead cleanse those who have leprosy drive out demons. Freely you have received freely give.
Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts
take no bag for the journey or extra tunic or sandals or a staff for the worker is worth his keep.
Whatever town or village you enter search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave.
As you enter the home give it your greeting.
If the home is deserving let your peace rest on it if it is not let your peace return to you.
If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.
I tell you the truth it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Be on your guard against men they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues.
On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say
for it will not be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brother will betray brother to death and a father his child children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
All men will hate you because of me but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
When you are persecuted in one place flee to another. I tell you the truth you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher and the servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub how much more the members of his household!
So do not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known.
What I tell you in the dark speak in the daylight what is whispered in your ear proclaim from the roofs.
Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.
After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
When John heard in prison what Christ was doing he sent his disciples
to ask him Are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else?
Jesus replied Go back and report to John what you hear and see
The blind receive sight the lame walk those who have leprosy are cured the deaf hear the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.
As Johns disciples were leaving Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
If not what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No those who wear fine clothes are in kings palaces.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes I tell you and more than a prophet.
This is the one about whom it is written  I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you.
I tell you the truth Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and forceful men lay hold of it.
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to accept it he is the Elijah who was to come.
He who has ears let him hear.
To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others
 We played the flute for you and you did not dance we sang a dirge and you did not mourn.
For John came neither eating nor drinking and they say He has a demon.
The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say Here is a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners.  But wisdom is proved right by her actions.
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent.
Woe to you Korazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you Capernaum will you be lifted up to the skies? No you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom it would have remained to this day.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
At that time Jesus said I praise you Father Lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children.
Yes Father for this was your good pleasure.
All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
When the Pharisees saw this they said to him Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.
He answered Havent you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and he and his companions ate the consecrated breadwhich was not lawful for them to do but only for the priests.
Or havent you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent?
I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
If you had known what these words mean I desire mercy not sacrifice you would not have condemned the innocent.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Going on from that place he went into their synagogue
and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus they asked him Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?
He said to them If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.
Then he said to the man Stretch out your hand. So he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
Aware of this Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him and he healed all their sick
warning them not to tell who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah
Here is my servant whom I have chosen the one I love in whom I delight I will put my Spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not quarrel or cry out no one will hear his voice in the streets.
A bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out till he leads justice to victory.
In his name the nations will put their hope.
Then they brought him a demonpossessed man who was blind and mute and Jesus healed him so that he could both talk and see.
All the people were astonished and said Could this be the Son of David?
But when the Pharisees heard this they said It is only by Beelzebub the prince of demons that this fellow drives out demons.
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If Satan drives out Satan he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub by whom do your people drive them out? So then they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or again how can anyone enter a strong mans house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me and he who does not gather with me scatters.
And so I tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come.
Make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad for a tree is recognized by its fruit.
You brood of vipers how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.
The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.
For by your words you will be acquitted and by your words you will be condemned.
Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him Teacher we want to see a miraculous sign from you.
He answered A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and now one greater than Jonah is here.
The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomons wisdom and now one greater than Solomon is here.
When an evil spirit comes out of a man it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
Then it says I will return to the house I left. When it arrives it finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order.
Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.
While Jesus was still talking to the crowd his mother and brothers stood outside wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him Your mother and brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you.
He replied to him Who is my mother and who are my brothers?
Pointing to his disciples he said Here are my mother and my brothers.
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.
That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.
Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it while all the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things in parables saying A farmer went out to sow his seed.
As he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up.
Some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.
But when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root.
Other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants.
Still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a cropa hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown.
He who has ears let him hear.
The disciples came to him and asked Why do you speak to the people in parables?
He replied The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you but not to them.
Whoever has will be given more and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him.
This is why I speak to them in parables Though seeing they do not see though hearing they do not hear or understand.
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah  You will be ever hearing but never understanding you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
For this peoples heart has become calloused they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear.
For I tell you the truth many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
Listen then to what the parable of the sower means
When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.
But since he has no root he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word he quickly falls away.
The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it making it unfruitful.
But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown.
Jesus told them another parable The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
When the wheat sprouted and formed heads then the weeds also appeared.
The owners servants came to him and said Sir didnt you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?
 An enemy did this he replied. The servants asked him Do you want us to go and pull them up?
 No he answered because while you are pulling the weeds you may root up the wheat with them.
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn. 
He told them another parable The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field.
Though it is the smallest of all your seeds yet when it grows it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.
He told them still another parable The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus
and he said to his attendants This is John the Baptist he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.
Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias his brother Philips wife
for John had been saying to him It is not lawful for you to have her.
Herod wanted to kill John but he was afraid of the people because they considered him a prophet.
On Herods birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for them and pleased Herod so much
that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
Prompted by her mother she said Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
The king was distressed but because of his oaths and his dinner guests he ordered that her request be granted
and had John beheaded in the prison.
His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl who carried it to her mother.
Johns disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
When Jesus heard what had happened he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
As evening approached the disciples came to him and said This is a remote place and its already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.
Jesus replied They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.
We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish they answered.
Bring them here to me he said.
And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
The number of those who ate was about five thousand men besides women and children.
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd.
After he had dismissed them he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came he was there alone
but the boat was already a considerable distance from land buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them walking on the lake.
When the disciples saw him walking on the lake they were terrified. Its a ghost they said and cried out in fear.
But Jesus immediately said to them Take courage! It is I. Dont be afraid.
Lord if its you Peter replied tell me to come to you on the water.
Come he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink cried out Lord save me!
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. You of little faith he said why did you doubt?
And when they climbed into the boat the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped him saying Truly you are the Son of God.
When they had crossed over they landed at Gennesaret.
And when the men of that place recognized Jesus they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him
and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak and all who touched him were healed.
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked
Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They dont wash their hands before they eat!
Jesus replied And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?
For God said Honor your father and mother and Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.
But you say that if a man says to his father or mother Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God
he is not to honor his father  with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you
 These people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me.
They worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men. 
Jesus called the crowd to him and said Listen and understand.
What goes into a mans mouth does not make him unclean but what comes out of his mouth that is what makes him unclean. 
Then the disciples came to him and asked Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?
He replied Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
Leave them they are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man both will fall into a pit.
Peter said Explain the parable to us.
Are you still so dull? Jesus asked them.
Dont you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart and these make a man unclean.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts murder adultery sexual immorality theft false testimony slander.
These are what make a man unclean but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean. 
Leaving that place Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him crying out Lord Son of David have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demonpossession.
Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him Send her away for she keeps crying out after us.
He answered I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.
The woman came and knelt before him. Lord help me! she said.
He replied It is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to their dogs.
Yes Lord she said but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied When evening comes you say It will be fair weather for the sky is red
and in the morning Today it will be stormy for the sky is red and overcast. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. Jesus then left them and went away.
When they went across the lake the disciples forgot to take bread.
Be careful Jesus said to them. Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
They discussed this among themselves and said It is because we didnt bring any bread.
Aware of their discussion Jesus asked You of little faith why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?
Do you still not understand? Dont you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many basketfuls you gathered?
Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many basketfuls you gathered?
How is it you dont understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples Who do people say the Son of Man is?
They replied Some say John the Baptist others say Elijah and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
But what about you? he asked. Who do you say I am?
Simon Peter answered You are the Christ the Son of the living God.
Jesus replied Blessed are you Simon son of Jonah for this was not revealed to you by man but by my Father in heaven.
And I tell you that you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. Never Lord! he said. This shall never happen to you!
Jesus turned and said to Peter Get behind me Satan! You are a stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the things of God but the things of men.
Then Jesus said to his disciples If anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it.
What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
After six days Jesus took with him Peter James and John the brother of James and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here. If you wish I will put up three sheltersone for you one for Moses and one for Elijah.
While he was still speaking a bright cloud enveloped them and a voice from the cloud said This is my Son whom I love with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!
When the disciples heard this they fell facedown to the ground terrified.
But Jesus came and touched them. Get up he said. Dont be afraid.
When they looked up they saw no one except Jesus.
As they were coming down the mountain Jesus instructed them Dont tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.
But I tell you Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.
When they came to the crowd a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.
Lord have mercy on my son he said. He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples but they could not heal him.
O unbelieving and perverse generation Jesus replied how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.
Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of the boy and he was healed from that moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked Why couldnt we drive it out?
He replied Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain Move from here to there and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.
When they came together in Galilee he said to them The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
They will kill him and on the third day he will be raised to life. And the disciples were filled with grief.
After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum the collectors of the twodrachma tax came to Peter and asked Doesnt your teacher pay the temple tax?
Yes he does he replied. When Peter came into the house Jesus was the first to speak. What do you think Simon? he asked. From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxesfrom their own sons or from others?
From others Peter answered. Then the sons are exempt Jesus said to him.
But so that we may not offend them go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch open its mouth and you will find a fourdrachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
He called a little child and had him stand among them.
And he said I tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.
But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come but woe to the man through whom they come!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away will he not leave the ninetynine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?
And if he finds it I tell you the truth he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninetynine that did not wander off.
In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost.
If your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you. If he listens to you you have won your brother over.
But if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
If he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Again I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
For where two or three come together in my name there am I with them.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked Lord how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?
Jesus answered I tell you not seven times but seventyseven times.
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
As he began the settlement a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
Since he was not able to pay the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
The servant fell on his knees before him. Be patient with me he begged and I will pay back everything.
The servants master took pity on him canceled the debt and let him go.
But when that servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. Pay back what you owe me! he demanded.
His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him Be patient with me and I will pay you back.
When Jesus had finished saying these things he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?
Havent you read he replied that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female
and said For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh?
So they are no longer two but one. Therefore what God has joined together let man not separate.
Why then they asked did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?
Jesus replied Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.
I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery.
The disciples said to him If this is the situation between a husband and wife it is better not to marry.
Jesus replied Not everyone can accept this word but only those to whom it has been given.
For some are eunuchs because they were born that way others were made that way by men and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.
Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
Jesus said Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.
When he had placed his hands on them he went on from there.
Now a man came up to Jesus and asked Teacher what good thing must I do to get eternal life?
Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus replied. There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life obey the commandments.
Which ones? the man inquired. Jesus replied  Do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not give false testimony
honor your father and mother and love your neighbor as yourself. 
All these I have kept the young man said. What do I still lack?
Jesus answered If you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come follow me.
When the young man heard this he went away sad because he had great wealth.
Then Jesus said to his disciples I tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Again I tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished and asked Who then can be saved?
Jesus looked at them and said With man this is impossible but with God all things are possible.
Peter answered him We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?
Jesus said to them I tell you the truth at the renewal of all things when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first.
For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.
About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
He told them You also go and work in my vineyard and I will pay you whatever is right.
So they went. He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing.
About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?
 Because no one has hired us they answered. He said to them You also go and work in my vineyard.
When evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman Call the workers and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.
The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.
So when those came who were hired first they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.
When they received it they began to grumble against the landowner.
These men who were hired last worked only one hour they said and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.
But he answered one of them Friend I am not being unfair to you. Didnt you agree to work for a denarius?
Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you.
Dont I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?
So the last will be first and the first will be last.
Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them
We are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!
Then the mother of Zebedees sons came to Jesus with her sons and kneeling down asked a favor of him.
What is it you want? he asked. She said Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.
You dont know what you are asking Jesus said to them. Can you drink the cup I am going to drink? We can they answered.
Jesus said to them You will indeed drink from my cup but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.
When the ten heard about this they were indignant with the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them.
Not so with you. Instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant
and whoever wants to be first must be your slave
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho a large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside and when they heard that Jesus was going by they shouted Lord Son of David have mercy on us!
The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet but they shouted all the louder Lord Son of David have mercy on us!
Jesus stopped and called them. What do you want me to do for you? he asked.
Lord they answered we want our sight.
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives Jesus sent two disciples
saying to them Go to the village ahead of you and at once you will find a donkey tied there with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.
If anyone says anything to you tell him that the Lord needs them and he will send them right away.
This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet
Say to the Daughter of Zion See your king comes to you gentle and riding on a donkey on a colt the foal of a donkey. 
The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
They brought the donkey and the colt placed their cloaks on them and Jesus sat on them.
A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
When Jesus entered Jerusalem the whole city was stirred and asked Who is this?
The crowds answered This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.
Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
It is written he said to them  My house will be called a house of prayer but you are making it a den of robbers. 
The blind and the lame came to him at the temple and he healed them.
But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area Hosanna to the Son of David they were indignant.
Do you hear what these children are saying? they asked him. Yes replied Jesus have you never read  From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise?
And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany where he spent the night.
Early in the morning as he was on his way back to the city he was hungry.
Seeing a fig tree by the road he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it May you never bear fruit again! Immediately the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this they were amazed. How did the fig tree wither so quickly? they asked.
Jesus replied I tell you the truth if you have faith and do not doubt not only can you do what was done to the fig tree but also you can say to this mountain Go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done.
If you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.
Jesus entered the temple courts and while he was teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. By what authority are you doing these things? they asked. And who gave you this authority?
Jesus replied I will also ask you one question. If you answer me I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
Johns baptismwhere did it come from? Was it from heaven or from men? They discussed it among themselves and said If we say From heaven he will ask Then why didnt you believe him?
But if we say From menwe are afraid of the people for they all hold that John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus We dont know. Then he said Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said Son go and work today in the vineyard.
 I will not he answered but later he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered I will sir but he did not go.
Which of the two did what his father wanted? The first they answered. Jesus said to them I tell you the truth the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this you did not repent and believe him.
Listen to another parable There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.
When the harvest time approached he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
The tenants seized his servants they beat one killed another and stoned a third.
Then he sent other servants to them more than the first time and the tenants treated them the same way.
Last of all he sent his son to them. They will respect my son he said.
But when the tenants saw the son they said to each other This is the heir. Come lets kill him and take his inheritance.
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants?
He will bring those wretches to a wretched end they replied and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.
Jesus said to them Have you never read in the Scriptures  The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone the Lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes?
Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces but he on whom it falls will be crushed.
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus parables they knew he was talking about them.
They looked for a way to arrest him but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.
Jesus spoke to them again in parables saying
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come but they refused to come.
Then he sent some more servants and said Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.
But they paid no attention and went offone to his field another to his business.
The rest seized his servants mistreated them and killed them.
The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants The wedding banquet is ready but those I invited did not deserve to come.
Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find both good and bad and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
But when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
Friend he asked how did you get in here without wedding clothes? The man was speechless.
Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.
They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. Teacher they said we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You arent swayed by men because you pay no attention to who they are.
Tell us then what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus knowing their evil intent said You hypocrites why are you trying to trap me?
Show me the coin used for paying the tax. They brought him a denarius
and he asked them Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?
Caesars they replied. Then he said to them Give to Caesar what is Caesars and to God what is Gods.
When they heard this they were amazed. So they left him and went away.
That same day the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him with a question.
Teacher they said Moses told us that if a man dies without having children his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.
Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died and since he had no children he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brother right on down to the seventh.
Finally the woman died.
Now then at the resurrection whose wife will she be of the seven since all of them were married to her?
Jesus replied You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage they will be like the angels in heaven.
But about the resurrection of the deadhave you not read what God said to you
I am the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.
When the crowds heard this they were astonished at his teaching.
Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees the Pharisees got together.
One of them an expert in the law tested him with this question
Teacher which is the greatest commandment in the Law?
Jesus replied  Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat.
So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do for they do not practice what they preach.
They tie up heavy loads and put them on mens shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for men to see They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long
they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues
they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them Rabbi.
But you are not to be called Rabbi for you have only one Master and you are all brothers.
And do not call anyone on earth father for you have one Father and he is in heaven.
Nor are you to be called teacher for you have one Teacher the Christ.
The greatest among you will be your servant.
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in mens faces. You yourselves do not enter nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert and when he becomes one you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.
Woe to you blind guides! You say If anyone swears by the temple it means nothing but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple he is bound by his oath.
You blind fools! Which is greater the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You also say If anyone swears by the altar it means nothing but if anyone swears by the gift on it he is bound by his oath.
You blind men! Which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And he who swears by heaven swears by Gods throne and by the one who sits on it.
Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spicesmint dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the lawjustice mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence.
Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish and then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead mens bones and everything unclean.
In the same way on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say If we had lived in the days of our forefathers we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.
So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
Fill up then the measure of the sin of your forefathers!
You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth all this will come upon this generation.
O Jerusalem Jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you were not willing.
Look your house is left to you desolate.
For I tell you you will not see me again until you say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. 
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.
Do you see all these things? he asked. I tell you the truth not one stone here will be left on another every one will be thrown down.
As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately. Tell us they said when will this happen and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?
Jesus answered Watch out that no one deceives you.
For many will come in my name claiming I am the Christ  and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen but the end is still to come.
Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
All these are the beginning of birth pains.
Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other
and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
Because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold
but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come.
So when you see standing in the holy place the abomination that causes desolation spoken of through the prophet Daniellet the reader understand
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house.
Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.
For then there will be great distress unequaled from the beginning of the world until nowand never to be equaled again.
If those days had not been cut short no one would survive but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
At that time if anyone says to you Look here is the Christ! or There he is! do not believe it.
For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the electif that were possible.
See I have told you ahead of time.
So if anyone tells you There he is out in the desert do not go out or Here he is in the inner rooms do not believe it.
For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Wherever there is a carcass there the vultures will gather.
Immediately after the distress of those days  the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of the heavens to the other.
Now learn this lesson from the fig tree As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out you know that summer is near.
Even so when you see all these things you know that it is near right at the door.
I tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away.
No one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father.
As it was in the days of Noah so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
For in the days before the flood people were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark
and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
Two men will be in the field one will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding with a hand mill one will be taken and the other left.
Therefore keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
But understand this If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.
So you also must be ready because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?
At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
The wise however took oil in jars along with their lamps.
The bridegroom was a long time in coming and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
At midnight the cry rang out Heres the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!
Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise Give us some of your oil our lamps are going out.
 No they replied there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.
But while they were on their way to buy the oil the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
Later the others also came. Sir! Sir! they said. Open the door for us!
But he replied I tell you the truth I dont know you.
Therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour.
Again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
To one he gave five talents of money to another two talents and to another one talent each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more.
So also the one with the two talents gained two more.
But the man who had received the one talent went off dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money.
After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. Master he said you entrusted me with five talents. See I have gained five more.
His master replied Well done good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your masters happiness!
The man with the two talents also came. Master he said you entrusted me with two talents see I have gained two more.
His master replied Well done good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your masters happiness!
Then the man who had received the one talent came. Master he said I knew that you are a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See here is what belongs to you.
His master replied You wicked lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
Well then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.
 Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
For everyone who has will be given more and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him.
And throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory.
All the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right Come you who are blessed by my Father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink I was a stranger and you invited me in
I needed clothes and you clothed me I was sick and you looked after me I was in prison and you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink?
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?
The King will reply I tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me.
Then he will say to those on his left Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink
I was a stranger and you did not invite me in I needed clothes and you did not clothe me I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.
They also will answer Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you?
He will reply I tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me.
Then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples
As you know the Passover is two days awayand the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest whose name was Caiaphas
and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him.
But not during the Feast they said or there may be a riot among the people.
While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper
a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this they were indignant. Why this waste? they asked.
This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.
Aware of this Jesus said to them Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
The poor you will always have with you but you will not always have me.
When she poured this perfume on my body she did it to prepare me for burial.
I tell you the truth wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world what she has done will also be told in memory of her.
Then one of the Twelvethe one called Judas Iscariotwent to the chief priests
and asked What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you? So they counted out for him thirty silver coins.
From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?
He replied Go into the city to a certain man and tell him The Teacher says My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house. 
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
And while they were eating he said I tell you the truth one of you will betray me.
They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other Surely not I Lord?
Jesus replied The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
Then Judas the one who would betray him said Surely not I Rabbi? Jesus answered Yes it is you.
While they were eating Jesus took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples saying Take and eat this is my body.
Then he took the cup gave thanks and offered it to them saying Drink from it all of you.
This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
I tell you I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Fathers kingdom.
When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Then Jesus told them This very night you will all fall away on account of me for it is written  I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.
But after I have risen I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter replied Even if all fall away on account of you I never will.
I tell you the truth Jesus answered this very night before the rooster crows you will disown me three times.
But Peter declared Even if I have to die with you I will never disown you. And all the other disciples said the same.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane and he said to them Sit here while I go over there and pray.
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
Then he said to them My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.
Going a little farther he fell with his face to the ground and prayed My Father if it is possible may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will but as you will.
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour? he asked Peter.
Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing but the body is weak.
He went away a second time and prayed My Father if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it may your will be done.
When he came back he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy.
So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time saying the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them Are you still sleeping and resting? Look the hour is near and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Rise let us go! Here comes my betrayer!
While he was still speaking Judas one of the Twelve arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them The one I kiss is the man arrest him.
Going at once to Jesus Judas said Greetings Rabbi! and kissed him.
Jesus replied Friend do what you came for. Then the men stepped forward seized Jesus and arrested him.
With that one of Jesus companions reached for his sword drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his ear.
Put your sword back in its place Jesus said to him for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
Do you think I cannot call on my Father and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?
At that time Jesus said to the crowd Am I leading a rebellion that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching and you did not arrest me.
But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
But Peter followed him at a distance right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they did not find any though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward
and declared This fellow said I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days. 
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him I charge you under oath by the living God Tell us if you are the Christ the Son of God.
Yes it is as you say Jesus replied. But I say to all of you In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look now you have heard the blasphemy.
Early in the morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.
They bound him led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
When Judas who had betrayed him saw that Jesus was condemned he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.
I have sinned he said for I have betrayed innocent blood. What is that to us? they replied. Thats your responsibility.
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests picked up the coins and said It is against the law to put this into the treasury since it is blood money.
So they decided to use the money to buy the potters field as a burial place for foreigners.
That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled They took the thirty silver coins the price set on him by the people of Israel
and they used them to buy the potters field as the Lord commanded me.
Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him Are you the king of the Jews? Yes it is as you say Jesus replied.
When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders he gave no answer.
Then Pilate asked him Dont you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?
But Jesus made no reply not even to a single chargeto the great amazement of the governor.
Now it was the governors custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.
At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered Pilate asked them Which one do you want me to release to you Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?
For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judges seat his wife sent him this message Dont have anything to do with that innocent man for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.
After the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
There was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women Do not be afraid for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
He is not here he has risen just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.
Then go quickly and tell his disciples He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him. Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb afraid yet filled with joy and ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. Greetings he said. They came to him clasped his feet and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee there they will see me.
While the women were on their way some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan they gave the soldiers a large sum of money
telling them You are to say His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.
If this report gets to the governor we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted.
Then Jesus came to them and said All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ the Son of God.
It is written in Isaiah the prophet I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way
a voice of one calling in the desert Prepare the way for the Lord make straight paths for him. 
And so John came baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothing made of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And this was his message After me will come one more powerful than I the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
I baptize you with water but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
As Jesus was coming up out of the water he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven You are my Son whom I love with you I am well pleased.
At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert
and he was in the desert forty days being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals and angels attended him.
After John was put in prison Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God.
The time has come he said. The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!
As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake for they were fishermen.
Come follow me Jesus said and I will make you fishers of men.
At once they left their nets and followed him.
When he had gone a little farther he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat preparing their nets.
Without delay he called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
They went to Capernaum and when the Sabbath came Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching because he taught them as one who had authority not as the teachers of the law.
Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out
What do you want with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!
Be quiet! said Jesus sternly. Come out of him!
The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
The people were all so amazed that they asked each other What is this? A new teachingand with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.
A few days later when Jesus again entered Capernaum the people heard that he had come home.
So many gathered that there was no room left not even outside the door and he preached the word to them.
Some men came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four of them.
Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and after digging through it lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.
When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic Son your sins are forgiven.
Now some teachers of the law were sitting there thinking to themselves
Why does this fellow talk like that? Hes blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts and he said to them Why are you thinking these things?
Which is easier to say to the paralytic Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up take your mat and walk?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . . . . He said to the paralytic
I tell you get up take your mat and go home.
He got up took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God saying We have never seen anything like this!
Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him and he began to teach them.
As he walked along he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collectors booth. Follow me Jesus told him and Levi got up and followed him.
While Jesus was having dinner at Levis house many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples for there were many who followed him.
When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors they asked his disciples Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?
On hearing this Jesus said to them It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners.
Now Johns disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus How is it that Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting but yours are not?
Jesus answered How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot so long as they have him with them.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and on that day they will fast.
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does the new piece will pull away from the old making the tear worse.
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does the wine will burst the skins and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No he pours new wine into new wineskins.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields and as his disciples walked along they began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to him Look why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?
He answered Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
In the days of Abiathar the high priest he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.
Then he said to them The Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath.
So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Another time he went into the synagogue and a man with a shriveled hand was there.
Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand Stand up in front of everyone.
Then Jesus asked them Which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to kill? But they remained silent.
He looked around at them in anger and deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts said to the man Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake and a large crowd from Galilee followed.
When they heard all he was doing many people came to him from Judea Jerusalem Idumea and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him to keep the people from crowding him.
For he had healed many so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.
Whenever the evil spirits saw him they fell down before him and cried out You are the Son of God.
But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.
Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted and they came to him.
He appointed twelvedesignating them apostlesthat they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach
and to have authority to drive out demons.
These are the twelve he appointed Simon 
James son of Zebedee and his brother John 
Andrew Philip Bartholomew Matthew Thomas James son of Alphaeus Thaddaeus Simon the Zealot
and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.
Then Jesus entered a house and again a crowd gathered so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.
When his family heard about this they went to take charge of him for they said He is out of his mind.
And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.
So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables How can Satan drive out Satan?
If a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand.
If a house is divided against itself that house cannot stand.
And if Satan opposes himself and is divided he cannot stand his end has come.
In fact no one can enter a strong mans house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.
I tell you the truth all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.
But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven he is guilty of an eternal sin.
He said this because they were saying He has an evil spirit.
Then Jesus mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside they sent someone in to call him.
A crowd was sitting around him and they told him Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.
Who are my mother and my brothers? he asked.
Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said Here are my mother and my brothers!
Whoever does Gods will is my brother and sister and mother.
Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake while all the people were along the shore at the waters edge.
He taught them many things by parables and in his teaching said
Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.
As he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up.
Some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.
But when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root.
Other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants so that they did not bear grain.
Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up grew and produced a crop multiplying thirty sixty or even a hundred times.
Then Jesus said He who has ears to hear let him hear.
When he was alone the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.
He told them The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables
so that  they may be ever seeing but never perceiving and ever hearing but never understanding otherwise they might turn and be forgiven! 
Then Jesus said to them Dont you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
The farmer sows the word.
Some people are like seed along the path where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
Others like seed sown on rocky places hear the word and at once receive it with joy.
But since they have no root they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word they quickly fall away.
Still others like seed sown among thorns hear the word
but the worries of this life the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word making it unfruitful.
Others like seed sown on good soil hear the word accept it and produce a cropthirty sixty or even a hundred times what was sown.
He said to them Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead dont you put it on its stand?
For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.
If anyone has ears to hear let him hear.
Consider carefully what you hear he continued. With the measure you use it will be measured to youand even more.
Whoever has will be given more whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him.
He also said This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.
Night and day whether he sleeps or gets up the seed sprouts and grows though he does not know how.
All by itself the soil produces grainfirst the stalk then the head then the full kernel in the head.
As soon as the grain is ripe he puts the sickle to it because the harvest has come.
Again he said What shall we say the kingdom of God is like or what parable shall we use to describe it?
It is like a mustard seed which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.
Yet when planted it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.
With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them as much as they could understand.
He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples he explained everything.
That day when evening came he said to his disciples Let us go over to the other side.
Leaving the crowd behind they took him along just as he was in the boat. There were also other boats with him.
A furious squall came up and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped.
Jesus was in the stern sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him Teacher dont you care if we drown?
He got up rebuked the wind and said to the waves Quiet! Be still! Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
He said to his disciples Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?
They were terrified and asked each other Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!
They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
When Jesus got out of the boat a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
This man lived in the tombs and no one could bind him any more not even with a chain.
For he had often been chained hand and foot but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
When he saw Jesus from a distance he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.
He shouted at the top of his voice What do you want with me Jesus Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you wont torture me!
For Jesus had said to him Come out of this man you evil spirit!
Then Jesus asked him What is your name? My name is Legion he replied for we are many.
And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
The demons begged Jesus Send us among the pigs allow us to go into them.
He gave them permission and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd about two thousand in number rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside and the people went out to see what had happened.
When they came to Jesus they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there dressed and in his right mind and they were afraid.
Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demonpossessed manand told about the pigs as well.
Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
As Jesus was getting into the boat the man who had been demonpossessed begged to go with him.
Jesus did not let him but said Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you.
So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
Then one of the synagogue rulers named Jairus came there. Seeing Jesus he fell at his feet
and pleaded earnestly with him My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.
So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
When she heard about Jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak
because she thought If I just touch his clothes I will be healed.
Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked Who touched my clothes?
You see the people crowding against you his disciples answered and yet you can ask Who touched me? 
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
Then the woman knowing what had happened to her came and fell at his feet and trembling with fear told him the whole truth.
He said to her Daughter your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.
While Jesus was still speaking some men came from the house of Jairus the synagogue ruler. Your daughter is dead they said. Why bother the teacher any more?
Ignoring what they said Jesus told the synagogue ruler Dont be afraid just believe.
He did not let anyone follow him except Peter James and John the brother of James.
When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler Jesus saw a commotion with people crying and wailing loudly.
He went in and said to them Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.
But they laughed at him. After he put them all out he took the childs father and mother and the disciples who were with him and went in where the child was.
He took her by the hand and said to her Talitha koum! .
Immediately the girl stood up and walked around . At this they were completely astonished.
He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this and told them to give her something to eat.
Jesus left there and went to his hometown accompanied by his disciples.
When the Sabbath came he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were amazed. Where did this man get these things? they asked. Whats this wisdom that has been given him that he even does miracles!
Isnt this the carpenter? Isnt this Marys son and the brother of James Joseph Judas and Simon? Arent his sisters here with us? And they took offense at him.
Jesus said to them Only in his hometown among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.
He could not do any miracles there except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.
Calling the Twelve to him he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.
These were his instructions Take nothing for the journey except a staffno bread no bag no money in your belts.
Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.
Whenever you enter a house stay there until you leave that town.
And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you shake the dust off your feet when you leave as a testimony against them.
They went out and preached that people should repent.
They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
King Herod heard about this for Jesus name had become well known. Some were saying John the Baptist has been raised from the dead and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.
Others said He is Elijah. And still others claimed He is a prophet like one of the prophets of long ago.
But when Herod heard this he said John the man I beheaded has been raised from the dead!
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias his brother Philips wife whom he had married.
For John had been saying to Herod It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife.
So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to
because Herod feared John and protected him knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John he was greatly puzzled yet he liked to listen to him.
Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl Ask me for anything you want and Ill give it to you.
And he promised her with an oath Whatever you ask I will give you up to half my kingdom.
She went out and said to her mother What shall I ask for? The head of John the Baptist she answered.
At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.
The king was greatly distressed but because of his oaths and his dinner guests he did not want to refuse her.
So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring Johns head. The man went beheaded John in the prison
and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl and she gave it to her mother.
On hearing of this Johns disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.
Then because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat he said to them Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.
So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
By this time it was late in the day so his disciples came to him. This is a remote place they said and its already very late.
Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.
The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and
saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were unclean that is unwashed.
(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing holding to the tradition of the elders.
When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions such as the washing of cups pitchers and kettles. )
So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus Why dont your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with unclean hands?
He replied Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites as it is written  These people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me.
They worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men.
You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.
And he said to them You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!
For Moses said Honor your father and your mother and Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.
But you say that if a man says to his father or mother Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban 
then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.
Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.
Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said Listen to me everyone and understand this.
Nothing outside a man can make him unclean by going into him. Rather it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean. 
After he had left the crowd and entered the house his disciples asked him about this parable.
Are you so dull? he asked. Dont you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him unclean?
For it doesnt go into his heart but into his stomach and then out of his body.
He went on What comes out of a man is what makes him unclean.
For from within out of mens hearts come evil thoughts sexual immorality theft murder adultery
greed malice deceit lewdness envy slander arrogance and folly.
All these evils come from inside and make a man unclean. 
Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it yet he could not keep his presence secret.
In fact as soon as she heard about him a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.
The woman was a Greek born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
First let the children eat all they want he told her for it is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to their dogs.
Yes Lord she replied but even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs.
Then he told her For such a reply you may go the demon has left your daughter.
She went home and found her child lying on the bed and the demon gone.
Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk and they begged him to place his hand on the man.
After he took him aside away from the crowd Jesus put his fingers into the mans ears. Then he spit and touched the mans tongue.
He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him Ephphatha! .
At this the mans ears were opened his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.
Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so the more they kept talking about it.
People were overwhelmed with amazement. He has done everything well they said. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.
During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat Jesus called his disciples to him and said
I have compassion for these people they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.
If I send them home hungry they will collapse on the way because some of them have come a long distance.
His disciples answered But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?
How many loaves do you have? Jesus asked. Seven they replied.
He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people and they did so.
They had a few small fish as well he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.
The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away
he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him they asked him for a sign from heaven.
He sighed deeply and said Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth no sign will be given to it.
Then he left them got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
The disciples had forgotten to bring bread except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.
Be careful Jesus warned them. Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.
They discussed this with one another and said It is because we have no bread.
Aware of their discussion Jesus asked them Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
Do you have eyes but fail to see and ears but fail to hear? And dont you remember?
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up? Twelve they replied.
And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up? They answered Seven.
He said to them Do you still not understand?
They came to Bethsaida and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.
He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the mans eyes and put his hands on him Jesus asked Do you see anything?
He looked up and said I see people they look like trees walking around.
Once more Jesus put his hands on the mans eyes. Then his eyes were opened his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly.
Jesus sent him home saying Dont go into the village. 
Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them Who do people say I am?
They replied Some say John the Baptist others say Elijah and still others one of the prophets.
But what about you? he asked. Who do you say I am? Peter answered You are the Christ. 
Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.
He spoke plainly about this and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples he rebuked Peter. Get behind me Satan! he said. You do not have in mind the things of God but the things of men.
Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said If anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul?
Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Fathers glory with the holy angels.
And he said to them I tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.
After six days Jesus took Peter James and John with him and led them up a high mountain where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.
His clothes became dazzling white whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.
And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses who were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus Rabbi it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three sheltersone for you one for Moses and one for Elijah.

Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them and a voice came from the cloud This is my Son whom I love. Listen to him!
Suddenly when they looked around they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
As they were coming down the mountain Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
They kept the matter to themselves discussing what rising from the dead meant.
And they asked him Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?
Jesus replied To be sure Elijah does come first and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?
But I tell you Elijah has come and they have done to him everything they wished just as it is written about him.
When they came to the other disciples they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
As soon as all the people saw Jesus they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.
What are you arguing with them about? he asked.
A man in the crowd answered Teacher I brought you my son who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
Whenever it seizes him it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit but they could not.
O unbelieving generation Jesus replied how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.
So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around foaming at the mouth.
Jesus asked the boys father How long has he been like this? From childhood he answered.
It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything take pity on us and help us.
 If you can? said Jesus. Everything is possible for him who believes.
Immediately the boys father exclaimed I do believe help me overcome my unbelief!
When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene he rebuked the evil spirit. You deaf and mute spirit he said I command you come out of him and never enter him again.
The spirit shrieked convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said Hes dead.
But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet and he stood up.
After Jesus had gone indoors his disciples asked him privately Why couldnt we drive it out?
He replied This kind can come out only by prayer. 
They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were
because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him and after three days he will rise.
But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house he asked them What were you arguing about on the road?
But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.
Sitting down Jesus called the Twelve and said If anyone wants to be first he must be the very last and the servant of all.
He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms he said to them
Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.
Teacher said John we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us.
Do not stop him Jesus said. No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me
for whoever is not against us is for us.
I tell you the truth anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.
And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.
If your hand causes you to sin cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell where the fire never goes out.
And if your foot causes you to sin cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
And if your eye causes you to sin pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell
where  their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.
Everyone will be salted with fire.
Salt is good but if it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with each other.
Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him and as was his custom he taught them.
Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?
What did Moses command you? he replied.
They said Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.
It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law Jesus replied.
But at the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife
and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two but one.
Therefore what God has joined together let man not separate.
When they were in the house again the disciples asked Jesus about this.
He answered Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.
And if she divorces her husband and marries another man she commits adultery.
People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them but the disciples rebuked them.
When Jesus saw this he was indignant. He said to them Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
I tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.
And he took the children in his arms put his hands on them and blessed them.
As Jesus started on his way a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. Good teacher he asked what must I do to inherit eternal life?
Why do you call me good? Jesus answered. No one is goodexcept God alone.
You know the commandments Do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not give false testimony do not defraud honor your father and mother. 
Teacher he declared all these I have kept since I was a boy.
Jesus looked at him and loved him. One thing you lack he said. Go sell everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come follow me.
At this the mans face fell. He went away sad because he had great wealth.
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again Children how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
Jesus looked at them and said With man this is impossible but not with God all things are possible with God.
Peter said to him We have left everything to follow you!
I tell you the truth Jesus replied no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age  and in the age to come eternal life.
But many who are first will be last and the last first.
They were on their way up to Jerusalem with Jesus leading the way and the disciples were astonished while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives Jesus sent two of his disciples
saying to them Go to the village ahead of you and just as you enter it you will find a colt tied there which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
If anyone asks you Why are you doing this? tell him The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly. 
They went and found a colt outside in the street tied at a doorway. As they untied it
some people standing there asked What are you doing untying that colt?
They answered as Jesus had told them to and the people let them go.
When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it he sat on it.
Many people spread their cloaks on the road while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.
Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted Hosanna!  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!
Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything but since it was already late he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
The next day as they were leaving Bethany Jesus was hungry.
Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it he found nothing but leaves because it was not the season for figs.
Then he said to the tree May no one ever eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard him say it.
On reaching Jerusalem Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves
and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
And as he taught them he said Is it not written  My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of robbers. 
The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him for they feared him because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
When evening came they went out of the city.
In the morning as they went along they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
Peter remembered and said to Jesus Rabbi look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!
Have faith in God Jesus answered.
I tell you the truth if anyone says to this mountain Go throw yourself into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen it will be done for him.
Therefore I tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours.
And when you stand praying if you hold anything against anyone forgive him so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.
They arrived again in Jerusalem and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts the chief priests the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.
By what authority are you doing these things? they asked. And who gave you authority to do this?
Jesus replied I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
Johns baptismwas it from heaven or from men? Tell me!
They discussed it among themselves and said If we say From heaven he will ask Then why didnt you believe him?
But if we say From men. . . .
So they answered Jesus We dont know. Jesus said Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
He then began to speak to them in parables A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.
At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
But they seized him beat him and sent him away emptyhanded.
Then he sent another servant to them they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.
He sent still another and that one they killed. He sent many others some of them they beat others they killed.
He had one left to send a son whom he loved. He sent him last of all saying They will respect my son.
But the tenants said to one another This is the heir. Come lets kill him and the inheritance will be ours.
So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.
Havent you read this scripture  The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone
the Lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes?
Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd so they left him and went away.
Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.
They came to him and said Teacher we know you are a man of integrity. You arent swayed by men because you pay no attention to who they are but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
Should we pay or shouldnt we? But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. Why are you trying to trap me? he asked. Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.
They brought the coin and he asked them Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription? Caesars they replied.
Then Jesus said to them Give to Caesar what is Caesars and to God what is Gods. And they were amazed at him.
Then the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him with a question.
Teacher they said Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife but no children the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.
Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.
The second one married the widow but he also died leaving no child. It was the same with the third.
In fact none of the seven left any children. Last of all the woman died too.
At the resurrection whose wife will she be since the seven were married to her?
Jesus replied Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?
When the dead rise they will neither marry nor be given in marriage they will be like the angels in heaven.
Now about the dead risinghave you not read in the book of Moses in the account of the bush how God said to him I am the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?
He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are badly mistaken!
One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer he asked him Of all the commandments which is the most important?
The most important one answered Jesus is this Hear O Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one.
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.
The second is this Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.
Well said teacher the man replied. You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
To love him with all your heart with all your understanding and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.
When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely he said to him You are not far from the kingdom of God. And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.
While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts he asked How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?
David himself speaking by the Holy Spirit declared  The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. 
As he was leaving the temple one of his disciples said to him Look Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!
Do you see all these great buildings? replied Jesus. Not one stone here will be left on another every one will be thrown down.
As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple Peter James John and Andrew asked him privately
Tell us when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?
Jesus said to them Watch out that no one deceives you.
Many will come in my name claiming I am he and will deceive many.
When you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed. Such things must happen but the end is still to come.
Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.
You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.
And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time for it is not you speaking but the Holy Spirit.
Brother will betray brother to death and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
All men will hate you because of me but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
When you see the abomination that causes desolation standing where it does not belonglet the reader understandthen let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out.
Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
Pray that this will not take place in winter
because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning when God created the world until nowand never to be equaled again.
If the Lord had not cut short those days no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect whom he has chosen he has shortened them.
At that time if anyone says to you Look here is the Christ! or Look there he is! do not believe it.
For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the electif that were possible.
So be on your guard I have told you everything ahead of time.
But in those days following that distress  the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light
the stars will fall from the sky and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
Now learn this lesson from the fig tree As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out you know that summer is near.
Even so when you see these things happening you know that it is near right at the door.
I tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away.
No one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father.
Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.
Its like a man going away He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge each with his assigned task and tells the one at the door to keep watch.
Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come backwhether in the evening or at midnight or when the rooster crows or at dawn.
If he comes suddenly do not let him find you sleeping.
What I say to you I say to everyone Watch! 
Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.
But not during the Feast they said or the people may riot.
While he was in Bethany reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another Why this waste of perfume?
It could have been sold for more than a years wages and the money given to the poor. And they rebuked her harshly.
Leave her alone said Jesus. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
The poor you will always have with you and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.
She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.
I tell you the truth wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world what she has done will also be told in memory of her.
Then Judas Iscariot one of the Twelve went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb Jesus disciples asked him Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?
So he sent two of his disciples telling them Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
Say to the owner of the house he enters The Teacher asks Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?
He will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.
The disciples left went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
When evening came Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
While they were reclining at the table eating he said I tell you the truth one of you will betray meone who is eating with me.
They were saddened and one by one they said to him Surely not I?
It is one of the Twelve he replied one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
While they were eating Jesus took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples saying Take it this is my body.
Then he took the cup gave thanks and offered it to them and they all drank from it.
This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many he said to them.
I tell you the truth I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.
When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Peter declared Even if all fall away I will not.
I tell you the truth Jesus answered todayyes tonightbefore the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.
But Peter insisted emphatically Even if I have to die with you I will never disown you. And all the others said the same.
They went to a place called Gethsemane and Jesus said to his disciples Sit here while I pray.
He took Peter James and John along with him and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death he said to them. Stay here and keep watch.
Going a little farther he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.
Abba Father he said everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will but what you will.
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. Simon he said to Peter are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?
Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing but the body is weak.
Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.
When he came back he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
Returning the third time he said to them Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!
Just as he was speaking Judas one of the Twelve appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests the teachers of the law and the elders.
Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them The one I kiss is the man arrest him and lead him away under guard.
Going at once to Jesus Judas said Rabbi! and kissed him.
The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
Very early in the morning the chief priests with the elders the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin reached a decision. They bound Jesus led him away and handed him over to Pilate.
Are you the king of the Jews? asked Pilate. Yes it is as you say Jesus replied.
The chief priests accused him of many things.
So again Pilate asked him Arent you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.
But Jesus still made no reply and Pilate was amazed.
Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.
A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.
The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews? asked Pilate
knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.
What shall I do then with the one you call the king of the Jews? Pilate asked them.
Crucify him! they shouted.
Why? What crime has he committed? asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder Crucify him!
Wanting to satisfy the crowd Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified.
The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace  and called together the whole company of soldiers.
They put a purple robe on him then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.
And they began to call out to him Hail king of the Jews!
Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees they paid homage to him.
When the Sabbath was over Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus body.
Very early on the first day of the week just after sunrise they were on their way to the tomb
and they asked each other Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?
But when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had been rolled away.
As they entered the tomb they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed.
Dont be alarmed he said. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.
But go tell his disciples and Peter He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him just as he told you. 
Trembling and bewildered the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.
When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had driven seven demons.
She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.
When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him they did not believe it.
Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.
These returned and reported it to the rest but they did not believe them either.
Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
He said to them Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
And these signs will accompany those who believe In my name they will drive out demons they will speak in new tongues
they will pick up snakes with their hands and when they drink deadly poison it will not hurt them at all they will place their hands on sick people and they will get well.
After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.
Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.
Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us
just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
Therefore since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you most excellent Theophilus
so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
Both of them were upright in the sight of God observing all the Lords commandments and regulations blamelessly.
But they had no children because Elizabeth was barren and they were both well along in years.
Once when Zechariahs division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God
he was chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
And when the time for the burning of incense came all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
When Zechariah saw him he was startled and was gripped with fear.
But the angel said to him Do not be afraid Zechariah your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to give him the name John.
He will be a joy and delight to you and many will rejoice because of his birth
for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.
Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.
And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteousto make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
Zechariah asked the angel How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.
The angel answered I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens because you did not believe my words which will come true at their proper time.
Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
When he came out he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
When his time of service was completed he returned home.
After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.
The Lord has done this for me she said. In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.
In the sixth month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth a town in Galilee
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph a descendant of David. The virgins name was Mary.
The angel went to her and said Greetings you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.
Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
But the angel said to her Do not be afraid Mary you have found favor with God.
You will be with child and give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus.
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever his kingdom will never end.
How will this be Mary asked the angel since I am a virgin?
The angel answered The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.
Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.
For nothing is impossible with God.
I am the Lords servant Mary answered. May it be to me as you have said. Then the angel left her.
At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea
where she entered Zechariahs home and greeted Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
In a loud voice she exclaimed Blessed are you among women and blessed is the child you will bear!
But why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!
And Mary said My soul glorifies the Lord
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed
for the Mighty One has done great things for me holy is his name.
His mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation.
He has performed mighty deeds with his arm he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.

And everyone went to his own town to register.
So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem the town of David because he belonged to the house and line of David.
He went there to register with Mary who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
While they were there the time came for the baby to be born
and she gave birth to her firstborn a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night.
An angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them and they were terrified.
But the angel said to them Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you he is Christ the Lord.
This will be a sign to you You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel praising God and saying
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.
When the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another Lets go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has told us about.
So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
When they had seen him they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child
and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
The shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen which were just as they had been told.
On the eighth day when it was time to circumcise him he was named Jesus the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.
When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord

and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord a pair of doves or two young pigeons.
Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lords Christ.
Moved by the Spirit he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required
Simeon took him in his arms and praised God saying
Sovereign Lord as you have promised you now dismiss your servant in peace.
For my eyes have seen your salvation
which you have prepared in the sight of all people
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.
The childs father and mother marveled at what was said about him.
Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be spoken against
so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.
There was also a prophetess Anna the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher. She was very old she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage
and then was a widow until she was eightyfour. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day fasting and praying.
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesarwhen Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea Herod tetrarch of Galilee his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene
during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.
He went into all the country around the Jordan preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet A voice of one calling in the desert Prepare the way for the Lord make straight paths for him.
Every valley shall be filled in every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight the rough ways smooth.
And all mankind will see Gods salvation. 
John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The ax is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
What should we do then? the crowd asked.
John answered The man with two tunics should share with him who has none and the one who has food should do the same.
Tax collectors also came to be baptized. Teacher they asked what should we do?
Dont collect any more than you are required to he told them.
Then some soldiers asked him And what should we do? He replied Dont extort money and dont accuse people falselybe content with your pay.
The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ.
John answered them all I baptize you with water. But one more powerful than I will come the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.
But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias his brothers wife and all the other evil things he had done
Herod added this to them all He locked John up in prison.
When all the people were being baptized Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying heaven was opened
and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven You are my Son whom I love with you I am well pleased.
Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son so it was thought of Joseph the son of Heli
the son of Matthat the son of Levi the son of Melki the son of Jannai the son of Joseph
the son of Mattathias the son of Amos the son of Nahum the son of Esli the son of Naggai

Jesus full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert
where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days and at the end of them he was hungry.
The devil said to him If you are the Son of God tell this stone to become bread.
Jesus answered It is written Man does not live on bread alone. 
The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
And he said to him I will give you all their authority and splendor for it has been given to me and I can give it to anyone I want to.
So if you worship me it will all be yours.
Jesus answered It is written Worship the Lord your God and serve him only. 
The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. If you are the Son of God he said throw yourself down from here.
For it is written  He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully
they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 
Jesus answered It says Do not put the Lord your God to the test. 
When the devil had finished all this tempting he left him until an opportune time.
Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit and news about him spread through the whole countryside.
He taught in their synagogues and everyone praised him.
He went to Nazareth where he had been brought up and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue as was his custom. And he stood up to read.
The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it he found the place where it is written
The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed
to proclaim the year of the Lords favor.
Then he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him
and he began by saying to them Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.
All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. Isnt this Josephs son? they asked.
Jesus said to them Surely you will quote this proverb to me Physician heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum. 
I tell you the truth he continued no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijahs time when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.
Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.
And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet yet not one of them was cleansedonly Naaman the Syrian.
All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
They got up drove him out of the town and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built in order to throw him down the cliff.
But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
Then he went down to Capernaum a town in Galilee and on the Sabbath began to teach the people.
They were amazed at his teaching because his message had authority.
In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice
Ha! What do you want with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!
Be quiet! Jesus said sternly. Come out of him! Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.
All the people were amazed and said to each other What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!
And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simons motherinlaw was suffering from a high fever and they asked Jesus to help her.
One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of God
he saw at the waters edge two boats left there by the fishermen who were washing their nets.
He got into one of the boats the one belonging to Simon and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
When he had finished speaking he said to Simon Put out into deep water and let down the nets for a catch.
Simon answered Master weve worked hard all night and havent caught anything. But because you say so I will let down the nets.
When they had done so they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.
So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
When Simon Peter saw this he fell at Jesus knees and said Go away from me Lord I am a sinful man!
For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken
and so were James and John the sons of Zebedee Simons partners. Then Jesus said to Simon Dont be afraid from now on you will catch men.
So they pulled their boats up on shore left everything and followed him.
While Jesus was in one of the towns a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus he fell with his face to the ground and begged him Lord if you are willing you can make me clean.
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. I am willing he said. Be clean! And immediately the leprosy left him.
Then Jesus ordered him Dont tell anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing as a testimony to them.
Yet the news about him spread all the more so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
One day as he was teaching Pharisees and teachers of the law who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick.
Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.
When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd right in front of Jesus.
When Jesus saw their faith he said Friend your sins are forgiven.
The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
Which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and walk?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.... He said to the paralyzed man I tell you get up take your mat and go home.
Immediately he stood up in front of them took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.
Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said We have seen remarkable things today.
After this Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. Follow me Jesus said to him
and Levi got up left everything and followed him.
Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?
Jesus answered them It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.
I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
They said to him Johns disciples often fast and pray and so do the disciples of the Pharisees but yours go on eating and drinking.
Jesus answered Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them in those days they will fast.
He told them this parable No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does he will have torn the new garment and the patch from the new will not match the old.
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does the new wine will burst the skins the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.
No new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
And no one after drinking old wine wants the new for he says The old is better. 
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.
Some of the Pharisees asked Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?
Jesus answered them Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and taking the consecrated bread he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.
Then Jesus said to them The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand Get up and stand in front of everyone. So he got up and stood there.
Then Jesus said to them I ask you which is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it?
He looked around at them all and then said to the man Stretch out your hand. He did so and his hand was completely restored.
But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray and spent the night praying to God.
When morning came he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them whom he also designated apostles
Simon  his brother Andrew James John Philip Bartholomew
Matthew Thomas James son of Alphaeus Simon who was called the Zealot
Judas son of James and Judas Iscariot who became a traitor.
He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea from Jerusalem and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon
who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil spirits were cured
and the people all tried to touch him because power was coming from him and healing them all.
Looking at his disciples he said Blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of God.
Blessed are you who hunger now for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh.
Blessed are you when men hate you when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.
But woe to you who are rich for you have already received your comfort.
Woe to you who are well fed now for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now for you will mourn and weep.
Woe to you when all men speak well of you for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets.
But I tell you who hear me Love your enemies do good to those who hate you
bless those who curse you pray for those who mistreat you.
If someone strikes you on one cheek turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak do not stop him from taking your tunic.
Give to everyone who asks you and if anyone takes what belongs to you do not demand it back.
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
If you love those who love you what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
And if you do good to those who are good to you what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.
And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners expecting to be repaid in full.
But love your enemies do good to them and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great and you will be sons of the Most High because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
Be merciful just as your Father is merciful.
Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.
Give and it will be given to you. A good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
He also told them this parable Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
A student is not above his teacher but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
How can you say to your brother Brother let me take the speck out of your eye when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite first take the plank out of your eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye.
No good tree bears bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.
Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes or grapes from briers.
The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.
Why do you call me Lord Lord and do not do what I say?
I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice.
He is like a man building a house who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came the torrent struck that house but could not shake it because it was well built.
But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house it collapsed and its destruction was complete.
When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people he entered Capernaum.
There a centurions servant whom his master valued highly was sick and about to die.
The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him asking him to come and heal his servant.
When they came to Jesus they pleaded earnestly with him This man deserves to have you do this
because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.
So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him Lord dont trouble yourself for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.
That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my servant will be healed.
For I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me. I tell this one Go and he goes and that one Come and he comes. I say to my servant Do this and he does it.
When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and turning to the crowd following him he said I tell you I have not found such great faith even in Israel.
Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.
Soon afterward Jesus went to a town called Nain and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.
As he approached the town gate a dead person was being carried outthe only son of his mother and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
When the Lord saw her his heart went out to her and he said Dont cry.
Then he went up and touched the coffin and those carrying it stood still. He said Young man I say to you get up!
The dead man sat up and began to talk and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
They were all filled with awe and praised God. A great prophet has appeared among us they said. God has come to help his people.
This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.
Johns disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them
he sent them to the Lord to ask Are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else?
When the men came to Jesus they said John the Baptist sent us to you to ask Are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else? 
At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases sicknesses and evil spirits and gave sight to many who were blind.
So he replied to the messengers Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard The blind receive sight the lame walk those who have leprosy are cured the deaf hear the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.
After Johns messengers left Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
If not what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes I tell you and more than a prophet.
This is the one about whom it is written  I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you.
I tell you among those born of women there is no one greater than John yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
(All the people even the tax collectors when they heard Jesus words acknowledged that Gods way was right because they had been baptized by John.
But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected Gods purpose for themselves because they had not been baptized by John.)
To what then can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other  We played the flute for you and you did not dance we sang a dirge and you did not cry.
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you say He has a demon.
The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you say Here is a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners. 
But wisdom is proved right by all her children.
Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him so he went to the Pharisees house and reclined at the table.
When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house she brought an alabaster jar of perfume
and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair kissed them and poured perfume on them.
When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself If this man were a prophet he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she isthat she is a sinner.
Jesus answered him Simon I have something to tell you. Tell me teacher he said.
Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii and the other fifty.
Neither of them had the money to pay him back so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?
Simon replied I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled. You have judged correctly Jesus said.
Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
You did not give me a kiss but this woman from the time I entered has not stopped kissing my feet.
You did not put oil on my head but she has poured perfume on my feet.
Therefore I tell you her many sins have been forgivenfor she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.
Then Jesus said to her Your sins are forgiven.
The other guests began to say among themselves Who is this who even forgives sins?
Jesus said to the woman Your faith has saved you go in peace.
After this Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him
and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases Mary  from whom seven demons had come out
Joanna the wife of Cuza the manager of Herods household Susanna and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town he told this parable
A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed some fell along the path it was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up.
Some fell on rock and when it came up the plants withered because they had no moisture.
Other seed fell among thorns which grew up with it and choked the plants.
Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop a hundred times more than was sown. When he said this he called out He who has ears to hear let him hear.
His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
He said The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you but to others I speak in parables so that  though seeing they may not see though hearing they may not understand.
This is the meaning of the parable The seed is the word of God.
Those along the path are the ones who hear and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.
Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it but they have no root. They believe for a while but in the time of testing they fall away.
The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by lifes worries riches and pleasures and they do not mature.
But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart who hear the word retain it and by persevering produce a crop.
No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead he puts it on a stand so that those who come in can see the light.
For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.
Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more whoever does not have even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.
Now Jesus mother and brothers came to see him but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.
Someone told him Your mother and brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.
He replied My mother and brothers are those who hear Gods word and put it into practice.
One day Jesus said to his disciples Lets go over to the other side of the lake. So they got into a boat and set out.
As they sailed he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake so that the boat was being swamped and they were in great danger.
The disciples went and woke him saying Master Master were going to drown! He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters the storm subsided and all was calm.
Where is your faith? he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water and they obey him.
They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes which is across the lake from Galilee.
When Jesus stepped ashore he was met by a demonpossessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house but had lived in the tombs.
When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice What do you want with me Jesus Son of the Most High God? I beg you dont torture me!
For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.
Jesus asked him What is your name? Legion he replied because many demons had gone into him.
And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.
A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them and he gave them permission.
When the demons came out of the man they went into the pigs and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
When those tending the pigs saw what had happened they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside
and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus feet dressed and in his right mind and they were afraid.
Those who had seen it told the people how the demonpossessed man had been cured.
Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him but Jesus sent him away saying
Return home and tell how much God has done for you. So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
Now when Jesus returned a crowd welcomed him for they were all expecting him.
Then a man named Jairus a ruler of the synagogue came and fell at Jesus feet pleading with him to come to his house
because his only daughter a girl of about twelve was dying. As Jesus was on his way the crowds almost crushed him.
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years but no one could heal her.
She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak and immediately her bleeding stopped.
Who touched me? Jesus asked. When they all denied it Peter said Master the people are crowding and pressing against you.
But Jesus said Someone touched me I know that power has gone out from me.
Then the woman seeing that she could not go unnoticed came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.
Then he said to her Daughter your faith has healed you. Go in peace.
While Jesus was still speaking someone came from the house of Jairus the synagogue ruler. Your daughter is dead he said. Dont bother the teacher any more.
Hearing this Jesus said to Jairus Dont be afraid just believe and she will be healed.
When he arrived at the house of Jairus he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter John and James and the childs father and mother.
Meanwhile all the people were wailing and mourning for her. Stop wailing Jesus said. She is not dead but asleep.
They laughed at him knowing that she was dead.
But he took her by the hand and said My child get up!
Her spirit returned and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.
Her parents were astonished but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
When Jesus had called the Twelve together he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases
and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
He told them Take nothing for the journeyno staff no bag no bread no money no extra tunic.
Whatever house you enter stay there until you leave that town.
If people do not welcome you shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town as a testimony against them.
So they set out and went from village to village preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead
others that Elijah had appeared and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.
But Herod said I beheaded John. Who then is this I hear such things about? And he tried to see him.
When the apostles returned they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida
but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God and healed those who needed healing.
Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging because we are in a remote place here.
He replied You give them something to eat. They answered We have only five loaves of bread and two fishunless we go and buy food for all this crowd.
But he said to his disciples Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.
The disciples did so and everybody sat down.
Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.
They all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him he asked them Who do the crowds say I am?
They replied Some say John the Baptist others say Elijah and still others that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.
But what about you? he asked. Who do you say I am? Peter answered The Christ of God.
Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
And he said The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
Then he said to them all If anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will save it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world and yet lose or forfeit his very self?
If anyone is ashamed of me and my words the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
I tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.
About eight days after Jesus said this he took Peter John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.
As he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.
Two men Moses and Elijah
appeared in glorious splendor talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
Peter and his companions were very sleepy but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
As the men were leaving Jesus Peter said to him Master it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three sheltersone for you one for Moses and one for Elijah.
While he was speaking a cloud appeared and enveloped them and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
A voice came from the cloud saying This is my Son whom I have chosen listen to him.
When the voice had spoken they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and told no one at that time what they had seen.
The next day when they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him.
A man in the crowd called out Teacher I beg you to look at my son for he is my only child.
A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.
I begged your disciples to drive it out but they could not.
O unbelieving and perverse generation Jesus replied how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.
After this the Lord appointed seventytwo others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.
He told them The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field.
Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
Do not take a purse or bag or sandals and do not greet anyone on the road.
When you enter a house first say Peace to this house.
If a man of peace is there your peace will rest on him if not it will return to you.
Stay in that house eating and drinking whatever they give you for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.
When you enter a town and are welcomed eat what is set before you.
Heal the sick who are there and tell them The kingdom of God is near you.
But when you enter a town and are not welcomed go into its streets and say
Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this The kingdom of God is near.
I tell you it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
Woe to you Korazin! Woe to you Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
And you Capernaum will you be lifted up to the skies? No you will go down to the depths.
He who listens to you listens to me he who rejects you rejects me but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.
The seventytwo returned with joy and said Lord even the demons submit to us in your name.
He replied I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy nothing will harm you.
However do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
At that time Jesus full of joy through the Holy Spirit said I praise you Father Lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. Yes Father for this was your good pleasure.
All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Then he turned to his disciples and said privately Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. Teacher he asked what must I do to inherit eternal life?
What is written in the Law? he replied. How do you read it?
He answered  Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and Love your neighbor as yourself. 
You have answered correctly Jesus replied. Do this and you will live.
But he wanted to justify himself so he asked Jesus And who is my neighbor?
In reply Jesus said A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes beat him and went away leaving him half dead.
A priest happened to be going down the same road and when he saw the man he passed by on the other side.
So too a Levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side.
But a Samaritan as he traveled came where the man was and when he saw him he took pity on him.
He went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey took him to an inn and took care of him.
The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. Look after him he said and when I return I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.
Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?
The expert in the law replied The one who had mercy on him. Jesus told him Go and do likewise.
As Jesus and his disciples were on their way he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.
She had a sister called Mary who sat at the Lords feet listening to what he said.
But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked Lord dont you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!
Martha Martha the Lord answered you are worried and upset about many things
but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her.
One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished one of his disciples said to him Lord teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.
He said to them When you pray say  Father hallowed be your name your kingdom come.
Give us each day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.  
Then he said to them Suppose one of you has a friend and he goes to him at midnight and says Friend lend me three loaves of bread
because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me and I have nothing to set before him.
Then the one inside answers Dont bother me. The door is already locked and my children are with me in bed. I cant get up and give you anything.
I tell you though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend yet because of the mans boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
So I say to you Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened.
Which of you fathers if your son asks for a fish will give him a snake instead?
Or if he asks for an egg will give him a scorpion?
If you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!
Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left the man who had been mute spoke and the crowd was amazed.
But some of them said By Beelzebub the prince of demons he is driving out demons.
Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined and a house divided against itself will fall.
If Satan is divided against himself how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.
Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub by whom do your followers drive them out? So then they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the finger of God then the kingdom of God has come to you.
When a strong man fully armed guards his own house his possessions are safe.
But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.
He who is not with me is against me and he who does not gather with me scatters.
When an evil spirit comes out of a man it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says I will return to the house I left.
When it arrives it finds the house swept clean and put in order.
Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first.
As Jesus was saying these things a woman in the crowd called out Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.
He replied Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.
As the crowds increased Jesus said This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.
For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.
The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomons wisdom and now one greater than Solomon is here.
The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and now one greater than Jonah is here.
No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand so that those who come in may see the light.
Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad your body also is full of darkness.
See to it then that the light within you is not darkness.
Therefore if your whole body is full of light and no part of it dark it will be completely lighted as when the light of a lamp shines on you.
When Jesus had finished speaking a Pharisee invited him to eat with him so he went in and reclined at the table.
But the Pharisee noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal was surprised.
Then the Lord said to him Now then you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
But give what is inside the dish to the poor and everything will be clean for you.
Woe to you Pharisees because you give God a tenth of your mint rue and all other kinds of garden herbs but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
Woe to you Pharisees because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
Woe to you because you are like unmarked graves which men walk over without knowing it.
One of the experts in the law answered him Teacher when you say these things you insult us also.
Jesus replied And you experts in the law woe to you because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.
Woe to you because you build tombs for the prophets and it was your forefathers who killed them.
So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did they killed the prophets and you build their tombs.
Because of this God in his wisdom said I will send them prophets and apostles some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.
Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes I tell you this generation will be held responsible for it all.
Woe to you experts in the law because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered and you have hindered those who were entering.
When Jesus left there the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions
waiting to catch him in something he might say.
Meanwhile when a crowd of many thousands had gathered so that they were trampling on one another Jesus began to speak first to his disciples saying Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy.
There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known.
What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.
I tell you my friends do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.
But I will show you whom you should fear Fear him who after the killing of the body has power to throw you into hell. Yes I tell you fear him.
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
Indeed the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Dont be afraid you are worth more than many sparrows.
I tell you whoever acknowledges me before men the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.
But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
When you are brought before synagogues rulers and authorities do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say
for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.
Someone in the crowd said to him Teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
Jesus replied Man who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?
Then he said to them Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed a mans life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
And he told them this parable The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop.
He thought to himself What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.
Then he said This is what Ill do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
And Ill say to myself You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy eat drink and be merry. 
But God said to him You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?
This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God.
Then Jesus said to his disciples Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear.
Life is more than food and the body more than clothes.
Consider the ravens They do not sow or reap they have no storeroom or barn yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!
Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
Since you cannot do this very little thing why do you worry about the rest?
Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
If that is how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire how much more will he clothe you O you of little faith!
And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink do not worry about it.
For the pagan world runs after all such things and your Father knows that you need them.
But seek his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well.
Do not be afraid little flock for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
For where your treasure is there your heart will be also.
Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
Jesus answered Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?
I tell you no! But unless you repent you too will all perish.
Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on themdo you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?
I tell you no! But unless you repent you too will all perish.
Then he told this parable A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.
So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard For three years now Ive been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and havent found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?
 Sir the man replied leave it alone for one more year and Ill dig around it and fertilize it.
If it bears fruit next year fine! If not then cut it down. 
On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues
and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.
When Jesus saw her he called her forward and said to her Woman you are set free from your infirmity.
Then he put his hands on her and immediately she straightened up and praised God.
Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath the synagogue ruler said to the people There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days not on the Sabbath.
The Lord answered him You hypocrites! Doesnt each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?
Then should not this woman a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?
When he said this all his opponents were humiliated but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
Then Jesus asked What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?
It is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree and the birds of the air perched in its branches.
Again he asked What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?
It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.
Then Jesus went through the towns and villages teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.
Someone asked him Lord are only a few people going to be saved? He said to them
Make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many I tell you will try to enter and will not be able to.
Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door you will stand outside knocking and pleading Sir open the door for us. But he will answer I dont know you or where you come from.
Then you will say We ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets.
But he will reply I dont know you or where you come from. Away from me all you evildoers!
There will be weeping there and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves thrown out.
People will come from east and west and north and south and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.
Indeed there are those who are last who will be first and first who will be last.
At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.
He replied Go tell that fox I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow and on the third day I will reach my goal.
In any case I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next dayfor surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!
O Jerusalem Jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you were not willing!
Look your house is left to you desolate. I tell you you will not see me again until you say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. 
One Sabbath when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee he was being carefully watched.
There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.
Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?
But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man he healed him and sent him away.
Then he asked them If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day will you not immediately pull him out?
And they had nothing to say.
When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table he told them this parable
When someone invites you to a wedding feast do not take the place of honor for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.
If so the host who invited both of you will come and say to you Give this man your seat. Then humiliated you will have to take the least important place.
But when you are invited take the lowest place so that when your host comes he will say to you Friend move up to a better place. Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests.
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Then Jesus said to his host When you give a luncheon or dinner do not invite your friends your brothers or relatives or your rich neighbors if you do they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.
But when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame the blind
and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.
When one of those at the table with him heard this he said to Jesus Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.
Jesus replied A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.
At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited Come for everything is now ready.
But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said I have just bought a field and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.
Another said I have just bought five yoke of oxen and Im on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.
Still another said I just got married so I cant come.
The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind and the lame.
 Sir the servant said what you ordered has been done but there is still room.
Then the master told his servant Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in so that my house will be full.
I tell you not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet. 
Large crowds were traveling with Jesus and turning to them he said
If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother his wife and children his brothers and sistersyes even his own lifehe cannot be my disciple.
And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?
For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it everyone who sees it will ridicule him
saying This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.
Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear him.
But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.
Then Jesus told them this parable
Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninetynine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
And when he finds it he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says Rejoice with me I have found my lost sheep.
I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninetynine righteous persons who do not need to repent.
Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
And when she finds it she calls her friends and neighbors together and says Rejoice with me I have found my lost coin.
In the same way I tell you there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
Jesus continued There was a man who had two sons.
The younger one said to his father Father give me my share of the estate. So he divided his property between them.
Not long after that the younger son got together all he had set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.
After he had spent everything there was a severe famine in that whole country and he began to be in need.
So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.
He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating but no one gave him anything.
When he came to his senses he said How many of my fathers hired men have food to spare and here I am starving to death!
I will set out and go back to my father and say to him Father I have sinned against heaven and against you.
I am no longer worthy to be called your son make me like one of your hired men.
So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son threw his arms around him and kissed him.
The son said to him Father I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. 
But the father said to his servants Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Lets have a feast and celebrate.
For this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found. So they began to celebrate.
Meanwhile the older son was in the field. When he came near the house he heard music and dancing.
So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.
Your brother has come he replied and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.
The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.
But he answered his father Look! All these years Ive been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.
But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home you kill the fattened calf for him!
Jesus told his disciples There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.
So he called him in and asked him What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management because you cannot be manager any longer.
The manager said to himself What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. Im not strong enough to dig and Im ashamed to beg
I know what Ill do so that when I lose my job here people will welcome me into their houses.
So he called in each one of his masters debtors. He asked the first How much do you owe my master?
 Eight hundred gallons of olive oil he replied. The manager told him Take your bill sit down quickly and make it four hundred.
Then he asked the second And how much do you owe?  A thousand bushels of wheat he replied. He told him Take your bill and make it eight hundred.
The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.
I tell you use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves so that when it is gone you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth who will trust you with true riches?
And if you have not been trustworthy with someone elses property who will give you property of your own?
No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
The Pharisees who loved money heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.
He said to them You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in Gods sight.
The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached and everyone is forcing his way into it.
It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.
Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus covered with sores
and longing to eat what fell from the rich mans table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abrahams side. The rich man also died and was buried.
In hell where he was in torment he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.
So he called to him Father Abraham have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue because I am in agony in this fire.
But Abraham replied Son remember that in your lifetime you received your good things while Lazarus received bad things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
And besides all this between us and you a great chasm has been fixed so that those who want to go from here to you cannot nor can anyone cross over from there to us.
He answered Then I beg you father send Lazarus to my fathers house
for I have five brothers. Let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment.
Abraham replied They have Moses and the Prophets let them listen to them.
 No father Abraham he said but if someone from the dead goes to them they will repent.
He said to him If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead. 
Jesus said to his disciples Things that cause people to sin are bound to come but woe to that person through whom they come.
It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.
So watch yourselves. If your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him.
If he sins against you seven times in a day and seven times comes back to you and says I repent forgive him.
The apostles said to the Lord Increase our faith!
He replied If you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mulberry tree Be uprooted and planted in the sea and it will obey you.
Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field Come along now and sit down to eat?
Would he not rather say Prepare my supper get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink after that you may eat and drink?
Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?
So you also when you have done everything you were told to do should say We are unworthy servants we have only done our duty. 
Now on his way to Jerusalem Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
As he was going into a village ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance
and called out in a loud voice Jesus Master have pity on us!
When he saw them he said Go show yourselves to the priests. And as they went they were cleansed.
One of them when he saw he was healed came back praising God in a loud voice.
He threw himself at Jesus feet and thanked himand he was a Samaritan.
Jesus asked Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?
Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?
Then he said to him Rise and go your faith has made you well.
Once having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come Jesus replied The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation
nor will people say Here it is or There it is because the kingdom of God is within you.
Then he said to his disciples The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man but you will not see it.
Men will tell you There he is! or Here he is! Do not go running off after them.
For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.
But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
Just as it was in the days of Noah so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
People were eating drinking marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building.
But the day Lot left Sodom fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
On that day no one who is on the roof of his house with his goods inside should go down to get them. Likewise no one in the field should go back for anything.
Remember Lots wife!
Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it and whoever loses his life will preserve it.
I tell you on that night two people will be in one bed one will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding grain together one will be taken and the other left.
Where Lord? they asked. He replied Where there is a dead body there the vultures will gather.
Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.
He said In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.
And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea Grant me justice against my adversary.
For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself Even though I dont fear God or care about men
yet because this widow keeps bothering me I will see that she gets justice so that she wont eventually wear me out with her coming! 
And the Lord said Listen to what the unjust judge says.
And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?
I tell you he will see that they get justice and quickly. However when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth?
To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else Jesus told this parable
Two men went up to the temple to pray one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself God I thank you that I am not like other menrobbers evildoers adulterersor even like this tax collector.
I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.
But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven but beat his breast and said God have mercy on me a sinner.
I tell you that this man rather than the other went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this they rebuked them.
But Jesus called the children to him and said Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
I tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.
A certain ruler asked him Good teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life?
Why do you call me good? Jesus answered. No one is goodexcept God alone.
You know the commandments Do not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not give false testimony honor your father and mother.
All these I have kept since I was a boy he said.
When Jesus heard this he said to him You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come follow me.
When he heard this he became very sad because he was a man of great wealth.
Jesus looked at him and said How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
Indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
Those who heard this asked Who then can be saved?
Jesus replied What is impossible with men is possible with God.
Peter said to him We have left all we had to follow you!
I tell you the truth Jesus said to them no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
will fail to receive many times as much in this age and in the age to come eternal life.
Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them We are going up to Jerusalem and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him insult him spit on him flog him and kill him.
On the third day he will rise again.
The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them and they did not know what he was talking about.
As Jesus approached Jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
When he heard the crowd going by he asked what was happening.
They told him Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.
He called out Jesus Son of David have mercy on me!
Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet but he shouted all the more Son of David have mercy on me!
Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near Jesus asked him
What do you want me to do for you? Lord I want to see he replied.
Jesus said to him Receive your sight your faith has healed you.
Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus praising God. When all the people saw it they also praised God.
Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
He wanted to see who Jesus was but being a short man he could not because of the crowd.
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamorefig tree to see him since Jesus was coming that way.
When Jesus reached the spot he looked up and said to him Zacchaeus come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.
So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
All the people saw this and began to mutter He has gone to be the guest of a sinner. 
But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord Look Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor and if I have cheated anybody out of anything I will pay back four times the amount.
Jesus said to him Today salvation has come to this house because this man too is a son of Abraham.
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.
While they were listening to this he went on to tell them a parable because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.
He said A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.
So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. Put this money to work he said until I come back.
But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say We dont want this man to be our king.
He was made king however and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money in order to find out what they had gained with it.
The first one came and said Sir your mina has earned ten more.
 Well done my good servant! his master replied. Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter take charge of ten cities.
The second came and said Sir your mina has earned five more.
His master answered You take charge of five cities.
Then another servant came and said Sir here is your mina I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.
I was afraid of you because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.
His master replied I will judge you by your own words you wicked servant! You knew did you that I am a hard man taking out what I did not put in and reaping what I did not sow?
Why then didnt you put my money on deposit so that when I came back I could have collected it with interest?
Then he said to those standing by Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.
 Sir they said he already has ten!
He replied I tell you that to everyone who has more will be given but as for the one who has nothing even what he has will be taken away.
But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here and kill them in front of me. 
After Jesus had said this he went on ahead going up to Jerusalem.
As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples saying to them
Go to the village ahead of you and as you enter it you will find a colt tied there which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
If anyone asks you Why are you untying it? tell him The Lord needs it. 
Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.
As they were untying the colt its owners asked them Why are you untying the colt?
They replied The Lord needs it.
They brought it to Jesus threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.
As he went along people spread their cloaks on the road.
When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen
Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus Teacher rebuke your disciples!
I tell you he replied if they keep quiet the stones will cry out.
As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city he wept over it
and said If you even you had only known on this day what would bring you peacebut now it is hidden from your eyes.
The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.
They will dash you to the ground you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another because you did not recognize the time of Gods coming to you.
Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.
It is written he said to them  My house will be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers.
One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel the chief priests and the teachers of the law together with the elders came up to him.
Tell us by what authority you are doing these things they said. Who gave you this authority?
He replied I will also ask you a question. Tell me
Johns baptismwas it from heaven or from men?
They discussed it among themselves and said If we say From heaven he will ask Why didnt you believe him?
But if we say From men all the people will stone us because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
So they answered We dont know where it was from.
Jesus said Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
He went on to tell the people this parable A man planted a vineyard rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.
At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away emptyhanded.
He sent another servant but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away emptyhanded.
He sent still a third and they wounded him and threw him out.
Then the owner of the vineyard said What shall I do? I will send my son whom I love perhaps they will respect him.
But when the tenants saw him they talked the matter over. This is the heir they said. Lets kill him and the inheritance will be ours.
So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. When the people heard this they said May this never be!
Jesus looked directly at them and asked Then what is the meaning of that which is written  The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone ?
Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces but he on whom it falls will be crushed.
The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
Keeping a close watch on him they sent spies who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.
So the spies questioned him Teacher we know that you speak and teach what is right and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.
Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
He saw through their duplicity and said to them
Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?
Caesars they replied. He said to them Then give to Caesar what is Caesars and to God what is Gods.
They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer they became silent.
Some of the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to Jesus with a question.
Teacher they said Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife but no children the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.
Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.
The second
and then the third married her and in the same way the seven died leaving no children.
Finally the woman died too.
Now then at the resurrection whose wife will she be since the seven were married to her?
Jesus replied The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.
But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage
and they can no longer die for they are like the angels. They are Gods children since they are children of the resurrection.
But in the account of the bush even Moses showed that the dead rise for he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
As he looked up Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury.
He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins.
I tell you the truth he said this poor widow has put in more than all the others.
All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.
Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said
As for what you see here the time will come when not one stone will be left on another every one of them will be thrown down.
Teacher they asked when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?
He replied Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name claiming I am he and The time is near. Do not follow them.
When you hear of wars and revolutions do not be frightened. These things must happen first but the end will not come right away.
Then he said to them Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
There will be great earthquakes famines and pestilences in various places and fearful events and great signs from heaven.
But before all this they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors and all on account of my name.
This will result in your being witnesses to them.
But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.
For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
You will be betrayed even by parents brothers relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death.
All men will hate you because of me.
But not a hair of your head will perish.
By standing firm you will gain life.
When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies you will know that its desolation is near.
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains let those in the city get out and let those in the country not enter the city.
For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
There will be signs in the sun moon and stars. On the earth nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.
Men will faint from terror apprehensive of what is coming on the world for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
When these things begin to take place stand up and lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing near.
He told them this parable Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
When they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
Even so when you see these things happening you know that the kingdom of God is near.
I tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away.
Be careful or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation drunkenness and the anxieties of life and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap.
For it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth.
Be always on the watch and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.
Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives
and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread called the Passover was approaching
and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus for they were afraid of the people.
Then Satan entered Judas called Iscariot one of the Twelve.
And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.
They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
He consented and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
Jesus sent Peter and John saying Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.
Where do you want us to prepare for it? they asked.
He replied As you enter the city a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters
and say to the owner of the house The Teacher asks Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?
He will show you a large upper room all furnished. Make preparations there.
They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
When the hour came Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.
And he said to them I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
For I tell you I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.
After taking the cup he gave thanks and said Take this and divide it among you.
For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.
And he took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them saying This is my body given for you do this in remembrance of me.
In the same way after the supper he took the cup saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you.
But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.
The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed but woe to that man who betrays him.
They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.
Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.
Jesus said to them The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.
But you are not to be like that. Instead the greatest among you should be like the youngest and the one who rules like the one who serves.
For who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
You are those who have stood by me in my trials.
And I confer on you a kingdom just as my Father conferred one on me
so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Simon Simon Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.
But I have prayed for you Simon that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back strengthen your brothers.
But he replied Lord I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.
Jesus answered I tell you Peter before the rooster crows today you will deny three times that you know me.
Then Jesus asked them When I sent you without purse bag or sandals did you lack anything? Nothing they answered.
He said to them But now if you have a purse take it and also a bag and if you dont have a sword sell your cloak and buy one.
It is written And he was numbered with the transgressors and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.
The disciples said See Lord here are two swords. That is enough he replied.
Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives and his disciples followed him.
On reaching the place he said to them Pray that you will not fall into temptation.
He withdrew about a stones throw beyond them knelt down and prayed
Father if you are willing take this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done.
An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.
And being in anguish he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.
When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples he found them asleep exhausted from sorrow.
Why are you sleeping? he asked them. Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.
While he was still speaking a crowd came up and the man who was called Judas one of the Twelve was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him
but Jesus asked him Judas are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?
When Jesus followers saw what was going to happen they said Lord should we strike with our swords?
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his right ear.
But Jesus answered No more of this! And he touched the mans ear and healed him.
Then Jesus said to the chief priests the officers of the temple guard and the elders who had come for him Am I leading a rebellion that you have come with swords and clubs?
Every day I was with you in the temple courts and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hourwhen darkness reigns.
Then seizing him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.
But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together Peter sat down with them.
Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.
And they began to accuse him saying We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ a king.
So Pilate asked Jesus Are you the king of the Jews? Yes it is as you say Jesus replied.
Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd I find no basis for a charge against this man.
But they insisted He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.
On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.
When he learned that Jesus was under Herods jurisdiction he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
When Herod saw Jesus he was greatly pleased because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him he hoped to see him perform some miracle.
He plied him with many questions but Jesus gave him no answer.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there vehemently accusing him.
Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe they sent him back to Pilate.
That day Herod and Pilate became friendsbefore this they had been enemies.
Pilate called together the chief priests the rulers and the people
and said to them You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.
Neither has Herod for he sent him back to us as you can see he has done nothing to deserve death.
Therefore I will punish him and then release him.
With one voice they cried out Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!

Wanting to release Jesus Pilate appealed to them again.
But they kept shouting Crucify him! Crucify him!
For the third time he spoke to them Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.
But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified and their shouts prevailed.
So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder the one they asked for and surrendered Jesus to their will.
As they led him away they seized Simon from Cyrene who was on his way in from the country and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.
A large number of people followed him including women who mourned and wailed for him.
Jesus turned and said to them Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me weep for yourselves and for your children.
For the time will come when you will say Blessed are the barren women the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!
Then  they will say to the mountains Fall on us! and to the hills Cover us! 
For if men do these things when the tree is green what will happen when it is dry?
Two other men both criminals were also led out with him to be executed.
When they came to the place called the Skull there they crucified him along with the criminalsone on his right the other on his left.
Jesus said Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing. And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
The people stood watching and the rulers even sneered at him. They said He saved others let him save himself if he is the Christ of God the Chosen One.
The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar
and said If you are the king of the Jews save yourself.
There was a written notice above him which read THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him Arent you the Christ? Save yourself and us!
But the other criminal rebuked him. Dont you fear God he said since you are under the same sentence?
We are punished justly for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.
Then he said Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom. 
Jesus answered him I tell you the truth today you will be with me in paradise.
It was now about the sixth hour and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour
for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
Jesus called out with a loud voice Father into your hands I commit my spirit. When he had said this he breathed his last.
The centurion seeing what had happened praised God and said Surely this was a righteous man.
When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place they beat their breasts and went away.
But all those who knew him including the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things.
Now there was a man named Joseph a member of the Council a good and upright man
who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.
Going to Pilate he asked for Jesus body.
On the first day of the week very early in the morning the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb
but when they entered they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
While they were wondering about this suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground but the men said to them Why do you look for the living among the dead?
He is not here he has risen! Remember how he told you while he was still with you in Galilee
The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men be crucified and on the third day be raised again. 
Then they remembered his words.
When they came back from the tomb they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
It was Mary Magdalene Joanna Mary the mother of James and the others with them who told this to the apostles.
But they did not believe the women because their words seemed to them like nonsense.
Peter however got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves and he went away wondering to himself what had happened.
Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus about seven miles from Jerusalem.
They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
As they talked and discussed these things with each other Jesus himself came up and walked along with them
but they were kept from recognizing him.
He asked them What are you discussing together as you walk along? They stood still their faces downcast.
One of them named Cleopas asked him Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?
What things? he asked. About Jesus of Nazareth they replied. He was a prophet powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.
The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death and they crucified him
but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more it is the third day since all this took place.
In addition some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning
but didnt find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.
Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but him they did not see.
He said to them How foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
As they approached the village to which they were going Jesus acted as if he were going farther.
But they urged him strongly Stay with us for it is nearly evening the day is almost over. So he went in to stay with them.
When he was at the table with them he took bread gave thanks broke it and began to give it to them.
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he disappeared from their sight.
They asked each other Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?
They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them assembled together
and saying It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.
Then the two told what had happened on the way and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
While they were still talking about this Jesus himself stood among them and said to them Peace be with you.
They were startled and frightened thinking they saw a ghost.
He said to them Why are you troubled and why do doubts rise in your minds?
Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.
When he had said this he showed them his hands and feet.
And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement he asked them Do you have anything here to eat?
They gave him a piece of broiled fish
and he took it and ate it in their presence.
He said to them This is what I told you while I was still with you Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses the Prophets and the Psalms.
Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.
He told them This is what is written The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations beginning at Jerusalem.
You are witnesses of these things.
I am going to send you what my Father has promised but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.
When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
He was with God in the beginning.
Through him all things were made without him nothing was made that has been made.
In him was life and that life was the light of men.
The light shines in the darkness but the darkness has not understood it.
There came a man who was sent from God his name was John.
He came as a witness to testify concerning that light so that through him all men might believe.
He himself was not the light he came only as a witness to the light.
The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.
He was in the world and though the world was made through him the world did not recognize him.
He came to that which was his own but his own did not receive him.
Yet to all who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of God
children born not of natural descent nor of human decision or a husbands will but born of God.
The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory the glory of the One and Only who came from the Father full of grace and truth.
John testifies concerning him. He cries out saying This was he of whom I said He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me. 
From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.
For the law was given through Moses grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
No one has ever seen God but God the One and Only who is at the Fathers side has made him known.
Now this was Johns testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.
He did not fail to confess but confessed freely I am not the Christ. 
They asked him Then who are you? Are you Elijah? He said I am not. Are you the Prophet? He answered No.
Finally they said Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?
John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet I am the voice of one calling in the desert Make straight the way for the Lord. 
Now some Pharisees who had been sent
On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus mother was there
and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
When the wine was gone Jesus mother said to him They have no more wine.
Dear woman why do you involve me? Jesus replied My time has not yet come.
His mother said to the servants Do whatever he tells you.
Nearby stood six stone water jars the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.
Jesus said to the servants Fill the jars with water so they filled them to the brim.
Then he told them Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet. They did so
and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
and said Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink but you have saved the best till now.
This the first of his miraculous signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory and his disciples put their faith in him.
After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.
When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
In the temple courts he found men selling cattle sheep and doves and others sitting at tables exchanging money.
So he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple area both sheep and cattle he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
To those who sold doves he said Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Fathers house into a market!
His disciples remembered that it is written Zeal for your house will consume me.
Then the Jews demanded of him What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?
Jesus answered them Destroy this temple and I will raise it again in three days.
The Jews replied It has taken fortysix years to build this temple and you are going to raise it in three days?
But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
After he was raised from the dead his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name.
But Jesus would not entrust himself to them for he knew all men.
He did not need mans testimony about man for he knew what was in a man.
Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a member of the Jewish ruling council.
He came to Jesus at night and said Rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.
In reply Jesus declared I tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. 
How can a man be born when he is old? Nicodemus asked. Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born!
Jesus answered I tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
Flesh gives birth to flesh but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
You should not be surprised at my saying You must be born again.
The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.
How can this be? Nicodemus asked.
You are Israels teacher said Jesus and do you not understand these things?
I tell you the truth we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen but still you people do not accept our testimony.
I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaventhe Son of Man.
Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert so the Son of Man must be lifted up
that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him.
Whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of Gods one and only Son.
This is the verdict Light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.
Everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.
After this Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside where he spent some time with them and baptized.
Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water and people were constantly coming to be baptized.

An argument developed between some of Johns disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.
They came to John and said to him Rabbi that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordanthe one you testified aboutwell he is baptizing and everyone is going to him.
To this John replied A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.
You yourselves can testify that I said I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.
The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him and is full of joy when he hears the bridegrooms voice. That joy is mine and it is now complete.
He must become greater I must become less.
The one who comes from above is above all the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.
He testifies to what he has seen and heard but no one accepts his testimony.
The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.
For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God for God gives the Spirit without limit.
The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life but whoever rejects the Son will not see life for Gods wrath remains on him.
The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John
although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized but his disciples.
So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
Jacobs well was there and Jesus tired as he was from the journey sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
When a Samaritan woman came to draw water Jesus said to her Will you give me a drink?

The Samaritan woman said to him You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?
Jesus answered her If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.
Sir the woman said you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?
Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?
Jesus answered Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again
but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.
The woman said to him Sir give me this water so that I wont get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.
He told her Go call your husband and come back.
I have no husband she replied. Jesus said to her You are right when you say you have no husband.
The fact is you have had five husbands and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.
Sir the woman said I can see that you are a prophet.
Our fathers worshiped on this mountain but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.
Jesus declared Believe me woman a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
You Samaritans worship what you do not know we worship what we do know for salvation is from the Jews.
Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
God is spirit and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.
The woman said I know that Messiah  is coming. When he comes he will explain everything to us.
Then Jesus declared I who speak to you am he.
Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked What do you want? or Why are you talking with her?
Then leaving her water jar the woman went back to the town and said to the people
Come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ ?
They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
Meanwhile his disciples urged him Rabbi eat something.
But he said to them I have food to eat that you know nothing about.
Then his disciples said to each other Could someone have brought him food?
My food said Jesus is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.
Do you not say Four months more and then the harvest? I tell you open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
Even now the reaper draws his wages even now he harvests the crop for eternal life so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.
Thus the saying One sows and another reaps is true.
I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.
Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the womans testimony He told me everything I ever did.
So when the Samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with them and he stayed two days.
And because of his words many more became believers.
They said to the woman We no longer believe just because of what you said now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.
After the two days he left for Galilee.

When he arrived in Galilee the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast for they also had been there.
Once more he visited Cana in Galilee where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
Some time later Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
Here a great number of disabled people used to liethe blind the lame the paralyzed.
One who was there had been an invalid for thirtyeight years.
When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time he asked him Do you want to get well?
Sir the invalid replied I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in someone else goes down ahead of me.
Then Jesus said to him Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.
At once the man was cured he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath
and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed It is the Sabbath the law forbids you to carry your mat.
But he replied The man who made me well said to me Pick up your mat and walk. 
So they asked him Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?
The man who was healed had no idea who it was for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him See you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.
The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
So because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath the Jews persecuted him.
Jesus said to them My Father is always at his work to this very day and I too am working.
For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was even calling God his own Father making himself equal with God.
Jesus gave them this answer I tell you the truth the Son can do nothing by himself he can do only what he sees his Father doing because whatever the Father does the Son also does.
For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.
For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.
Moreover the Father judges no one but has entrusted all judgment to the Son
that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
I tell you the truth whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned he has crossed over from death to life.
I tell you the truth a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
For as the Father has life in himself so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.
And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.
Do not be amazed at this for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
and come outthose who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.
By myself I can do nothing I judge only as I hear and my judgment is just for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.
If I testify about myself my testimony is not valid.
There is another who testifies in my favor and I know that his testimony about me is valid.
You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.
Not that I accept human testimony but I mention it that you may be saved.
John was a lamp that burned and gave light and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.
I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish and which I am doing testifies that the Father has sent me.
And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form
nor does his word dwell in you for you do not believe the one he sent.
You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me
yet you refuse to come to me to have life.
I do not accept praise from men
but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.
I have come in my Fathers name and you do not accept me but if someone else comes in his own name you will accept him.
How can you believe if you accept praise from one another yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God ?
But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses on whom your hopes are set.
If you believed Moses you would believe me for he wrote about me.
But since you do not believe what he wrote how are you going to believe what I say?
Some time after this Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee 
and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.
Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.
The Jewish Passover Feast was near.
When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him he said to Philip Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?
He asked this only to test him for he already had in mind what he was going to do.
Philip answered him Eight months wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!
Another of his disciples Andrew Simon Peters brother spoke up
Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish but how far will they go among so many?
Jesus said Have the people sit down. There was plenty of grass in that place and the men sat down about five thousand of them.
Jesus then took the loaves gave thanks and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
When they had all had enough to eat he said to his disciples Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.
So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did they began to say Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.
Jesus knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
When evening came his disciples went down to the lake
where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark and Jesus had not yet joined them.
A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.
When they had rowed three or three and a half miles they saw Jesus approaching the boat walking on the water and they were terrified.
But he said to them It is I dont be afraid.
Then they were willing to take him into the boat and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples but that they had gone away alone.
Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
When they found him on the other side of the lake they asked him Rabbi when did you get here?
Jesus answered I tell you the truth you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
Do not work for food that spoils but for food that endures to eternal life which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.
Then they asked him What must we do to do the works God requires?
Jesus answered The work of God is this to believe in the one he has sent.
So they asked him What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?
Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert as it is written He gave them bread from heaven to eat. 
Jesus said to them I tell you the truth it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.
Sir they said from now on give us this bread.
Then Jesus declared I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.
But as I told you you have seen me and still you do not believe.
All that the Father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.
And this is the will of him who sent me that I shall lose none of all that he has given me but raise them up at the last day.
For my Fathers will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day.
At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven.
They said Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know? How can he now say I came down from heaven?
Stop grumbling among yourselves Jesus answered.
No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him and I will raise him up at the last day.
It is written in the Prophets They will all be taught by God. Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.
No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God only he has seen the Father.
I tell you the truth he who believes has everlasting life.
I am the bread of life.
Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert yet they died.
But here is the bread that comes down from heaven which a man may eat and not die.
I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever. This bread is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.
Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
After this Jesus went around in Galilee purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.
But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near
Jesus brothers said to him You ought to leave here and go to Judea so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.
No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things show yourself to the world.
For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
Therefore Jesus told them The right time for me has not yet come for you any time is right.
The world cannot hate you but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.
You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast because for me the right time has not yet come.
Having said this he stayed in Galilee.
However after his brothers had left for the Feast he went also not publicly but in secret.
Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking Where is that man?
Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said He is a good man. Others replied No he deceives the people.
But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.
Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.
The Jews were amazed and asked How did this man get such learning without having studied?
Jesus answered My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.
If anyone chooses to do Gods will he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.
He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth there is nothing false about him.
Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?
You are demonpossessed the crowd answered. Who is trying to kill you?
Jesus said to them I did one miracle and you are all astonished.
Yet because Moses gave you circumcision  you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.
Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?
Stop judging by mere appearances and make a right judgment.
At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask Isnt this the man they are trying to kill?
Here he is speaking publicly and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ ?
But we know where this man is from when the Christ comes no one will know where he is from.
Then Jesus still teaching in the temple courts cried out Yes you know me and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own but he who sent me is true. You do not know him
but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.
At this they tried to seize him but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come.
Still many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said When the Christ comes will he do more miraculous signs than this man?
The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
Jesus said I am with you for only a short time and then I go to the one who sent me.
You will look for me but you will not find me and where I am you cannot come.
The Jews said to one another Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
What did he mean when he said You will look for me but you will not find me and Where I am you cannot come?
On the last and greatest day of the Feast Jesus stood and said in a loud voice If anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink.
Whoever believes in me as the Scripture has said streams of living water will flow from within him.
By this he meant the Spirit whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
On hearing his words some of the people said Surely this man is the Prophet.
Others said He is the Christ. Still others asked How can the Christ come from Galilee?
Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from Davids family and from Bethlehem the town where David lived?
Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.
Some wanted to seize him but no one laid a hand on him.
Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees who asked them Why didnt you bring him in?
No one ever spoke the way this man does the guards declared.
You mean he has deceived you also? the Pharisees retorted.
Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
No! But this mob that knows nothing of the lawthere is a curse on them.
Nicodemus who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number asked
Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?
They replied Are you from Galilee too? Look into it and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.
Then each went to his own home.
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts where all the people gathered around him and he sat down to teach them.
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group
and said to Jesus Teacher this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?
They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
When they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them If any one of you is without sin let him be the first to throw a stone at her.
Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
At this those who heard began to go away one at a time the older ones first until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.
Jesus straightened up and asked her Woman where are they? Has no one condemned you?
No one sir she said. Then neither do I condemn you Jesus declared. Go now and leave your life of sin.
When Jesus spoke again to the people he said I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.
The Pharisees challenged him Here you are appearing as your own witness your testimony is not valid.
Jesus answered Even if I testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.
You judge by human standards I pass judgment on no one.
But if I do judge my decisions are right because I am not alone. I stand with the Father who sent me.
In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.
I am one who testifies for myself my other witness is the Father who sent me.
Then they asked him Where is your father? You do not know me or my Father Jesus replied. If you knew me you would know my Father also.
He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him because his time had not yet come.
Once more Jesus said to them I am going away and you will look for me and you will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.
This made the Jews ask Will he kill himself? Is that why he says Where I go you cannot come?
But he continued You are from below I am from above. You are of this world I am not of this world.
I told you that you would die in your sins if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be you will indeed die in your sins.
Who are you? they asked. Just what I have been claiming all along Jesus replied.
I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable and what I have heard from him I tell the world.
They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
So Jesus said When you have lifted up the Son of Man then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
The one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for I always do what pleases him.
Even as he spoke many put their faith in him.
To the Jews who had believed him Jesus said If you hold to my teaching you are really my disciples.
Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
They answered him We are Abrahams descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?
Jesus replied I tell you the truth everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
Now a slave has no permanent place in the family but a son belongs to it forever.
So if the Son sets you free you will be free indeed.
I know you are Abrahams descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me because you have no room for my word.
I am telling you what I have seen in the Fathers presence and you do what you have heard from your father. 
Abraham is our father they answered. If you were Abrahams children said Jesus then you would do the things Abraham did.
As it is you are determined to kill me a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
As he went along he saw a man blind from birth.
His disciples asked him Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind?
Neither this man nor his parents sinned said Jesus but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.
As long as it is day we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming when no one can work.
While I am in the world I am the light of the world.
Having said this he spit on the ground made some mud with the saliva and put it on the mans eyes.
Go he told him wash in the Pool of Siloam . So the man went and washed and came home seeing.
His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked Isnt this the same man who used to sit and beg?
Some claimed that he was. Others said No he only looks like him. But he himself insisted I am the man.
How then were your eyes opened? they demanded.
He replied The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and then I could see.
Where is this man? they asked him. I dont know he said.
They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the mans eyes was a Sabbath.
Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He put mud on my eyes the man replied and I washed and now I see.
Some of the Pharisees said This man is not from God for he does not keep the Sabbath. But others asked How can a sinner do such miraculous signs? So they were divided.
Finally they turned again to the blind man What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened. The man replied He is a prophet.
The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the mans parents.
Is this your son? they asked. Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?
We know he is our son the parents answered and we know he was born blind.
But how he can see now or who opened his eyes we dont know. Ask him. He is of age he will speak for himself.
His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.
That was why his parents said He is of age ask him.
A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. Give glory to God  they said. We know this man is a sinner.
He replied Whether he is a sinner or not I dont know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!
Then they asked him What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?
He answered I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?
Then they hurled insults at him and said You are this fellows disciple! We are disciples of Moses!
We know that God spoke to Moses but as for this fellow we dont even know where he comes from.
The man answered Now that is remarkable! You dont know where he comes from yet he opened my eyes.
We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.
Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
If this man were not from God he could do nothing.
To this they replied You were steeped in sin at birth how dare you lecture us! And they threw him out.
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out and when he found him he said Do you believe in the Son of Man?
Who is he sir? the man asked. Tell me so that I may believe in him.
Jesus said You have now seen him in fact he is the one speaking with you.
Then the man said Lord I believe and he worshiped him.
Jesus said For judgment I have come into this world so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.
Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked What? Are we blind too?
Jesus said If you were blind you would not be guilty of sin but now that you claim you can see your guilt remains.
I tell you the truth the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in by some other way is a thief and a robber.
The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.
The watchman opens the gate for him and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
When he has brought out all his own he goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
But they will never follow a stranger in fact they will run away from him because they do not recognize a strangers voice.
Jesus used this figure of speech but they did not understand what he was telling them.
Therefore Jesus said again I tell you the truth I am the gate for the sheep.
All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers but the sheep did not listen to them.
I am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd I know my sheep and my sheep know me
just as the Father knows me and I know the Fatherand I lay down my life for the sheep.
I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my lifeonly to take it up again.
No one takes it from me but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.
At these words the Jews were again divided.
Many of them said He is demonpossessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?
But others said These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter
and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomons Colonnade.
The Jews gathered around him saying How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ tell us plainly.
Jesus answered I did tell you but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Fathers name speak for me
but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.
My sheep listen to my voice I know them and they follow me.
I give them eternal life and they shall never perish no one can snatch them out of my hand.
My Father who has given them to me is greater than all  no one can snatch them out of my Fathers hand.
I and the Father are one.
Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him
but Jesus said to them I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?
We are not stoning you for any of these replied the Jews but for blasphemy because you a mere man claim to be God.
Jesus answered them Is it not written in your Law I have said you are gods ?
If he called them gods to whom the word of God cameand the Scripture cannot be broken
what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said I am Gods Son?
Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does.
But if I do it even though you do not believe me believe the miracles that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I in the Father.
Again they tried to seize him but he escaped their grasp.
Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed
and many people came to him. They said Though John never performed a miraculous sign all that John said about this man was true.
And in that place many believed in Jesus.
Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
This Mary whose brother Lazarus now lay sick was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.
So the sisters sent word to Jesus Lord the one you love is sick.
When he heard this Jesus said This sickness will not end in death. No it is for Gods glory so that Gods Son may be glorified through it.
Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick he stayed where he was two more days.
Then he said to his disciples Let us go back to Judea.
But Rabbi they said a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you and yet you are going back there?
Jesus answered Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble for he sees by this worlds light.
It is when he walks by night that he stumbles for he has no light.
After he had said this he went on to tell them Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I am going there to wake him up.
His disciples replied Lord if he sleeps he will get better.
Jesus had been speaking of his death but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.
So then he told them plainly Lazarus is dead
and for your sake I am glad I was not there so that you may believe. But let us go to him.
Then Thomas  said to the rest of the disciples Let us also go that we may die with him.
On his arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem
and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went out to meet him but Mary stayed at home.
Lord Martha said to Jesus if you had been here my brother would not have died.
But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.
Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again.
Martha answered I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live even though he dies
and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?
Yes Lord she told him I believe that you are the Christ the Son of God who was to come into the world.
And after she had said this she went back and called her sister Mary aside. The Teacher is here she said and is asking for you.
When Mary heard this she got up quickly and went to him.
Now Jesus had not yet entered the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house comforting her noticed how quickly she got up and went out they followed her supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him she fell at his feet and said Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died.
When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
Where have you laid him? he asked. Come and see Lord they replied.
Jesus wept.
Then the Jews said See how he loved him!
But some of them said Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?
Jesus once more deeply moved came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
Take away the stone he said. But Lord said Martha the sister of the dead man by this time there is a bad odor for he has been there four days.
Then Jesus said Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?
So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said Father I thank you that you have heard me.
I knew that you always hear me but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here that they may believe that you sent me.
When he had said this Jesus called in a loud voice Lazarus come out!
The dead man came out his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them Take off the grave clothes and let him go.
Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did put their faith in him.
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. What are we accomplishing? they asked. Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.
If we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
Then one of them named Caiaphas who was high priest that year spoke up You know nothing at all!
Six days before the Passover Jesus arrived at Bethany where Lazarus lived whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
Here a dinner was given in Jesus honor. Martha served while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.
Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard an expensive perfume she poured it on Jesus feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
But one of his disciples Judas Iscariot who was later to betray him objected
Why wasnt this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a years wages. 
He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief as keeper of the money bag he used to help himself to what was put into it.
Leave her alone Jesus replied. It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
You will always have the poor among you but you will not always have me.
Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.
So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well
for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.
The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.
They took palm branches and went out to meet him shouting Hosanna!  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the King of Israel!
Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it as it is written
Do not be afraid O Daughter of Zion see your king is coming seated on a donkeys colt.
At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.
Many people because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign went out to meet him.
So the Pharisees said to one another See this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!
Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.
They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee with a request. Sir they said we would like to see Jesus.
Philip went to tell Andrew Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
Jesus replied The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
I tell you the truth unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies it remains only a single seed. But if it dies it produces many seeds.
The man who loves his life will lose it while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
Whoever serves me must follow me and where I am my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.
Now my heart is troubled and what shall I say? Father save me from this hour? No it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
Father glorify your name! Then a voice came from heaven I have glorified it and will glorify it again.
The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered others said an angel had spoken to him.
Jesus said This voice was for your benefit not mine.
Now is the time for judgment on this world now the prince of this world will be driven out.
But I when I am lifted up from the earth will draw all men to myself.
He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
The crowd spoke up We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever so how can you say The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?
Then Jesus told them You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.
Put your trust in the light while you have it so that you may become sons of light. When he had finished speaking Jesus left and hid himself from them.
Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence they still would not believe in him.
It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world he now showed them the full extent of his love.
The evening meal was being served and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot son of Simon to betray Jesus.
Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God
so he got up from the meal took off his outer clothing and wrapped a towel around his waist.
After that he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
He came to Simon Peter who said to him Lord are you going to wash my feet?
Jesus replied You do not realize now what I am doing but later you will understand.
No said Peter you shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered Unless I wash you you have no part with me.
Then Lord Simon Peter replied not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!
Jesus answered A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet his whole body is clean. And you are clean though not every one of you.
For he knew who was going to betray him and that was why he said not every one was clean.
When he had finished washing their feet he put on his clothes and returned to his place. Do you understand what I have done for you? he asked them.
You call me Teacher and Lord and rightly so for that is what I am.
Now that I your Lord and Teacher have washed your feet you also should wash one anothers feet.
I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
I tell you the truth no servant is greater than his master nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
Now that you know these things you will be blessed if you do them.
I am not referring to all of you I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me.
I am telling you now before it happens so that when it does happen you will believe that I am He.
I tell you the truth whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.
After he had said this Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified I tell you the truth one of you is going to betray me.
His disciples stared at one another at a loss to know which of them he meant.
One of them the disciple whom Jesus loved was reclining next to him.
Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said Ask him which one he means.
Leaning back against Jesus he asked him Lord who is it?
Jesus answered It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish. Then dipping the piece of bread he gave it to Judas Iscariot son of Simon.
As soon as Judas took the bread Satan entered into him. What you are about to do do quickly Jesus told him
but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.
Since Judas had charge of the money some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast or to give something to the poor.
As soon as Judas had taken the bread he went out. And it was night.
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God  trust also in me.
In my Fathers house are many rooms if it were not so I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.
And if I go and prepare a place for you I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
You know the way to the place where I am going.
Thomas said to him Lord we dont know where you are going so how can we know the way?
Jesus answered I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
If you really knew me you would know my Father as well. From now on you do know him and have seen him.
Philip said Lord show us the Father and that will be enough for us.
Jesus answered Dont you know me Philip even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say Show us the Father?
Dont you believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather it is the Father living in me who is doing his work.
Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves.
I tell you the truth anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these because I am going to the Father.
And I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.
You may ask me for anything in my name and I will do it.
If you love me you will obey what I command.
And I will ask the Father and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever
the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him for he lives with you and will be in you.
I will not leave you as orphans I will come to you.
Before long the world will not see me anymore but you will see me. Because I live you also will live.
On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you.
Whoever has my commands and obeys them he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father and I too will love him and show myself to him.
Then Judas  said But Lord why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?
Jesus replied If anyone loves me he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him.
He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own they belong to the Father who sent me.
All this I have spoken while still with you.
But the Counselor the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener.
He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.
You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
Remain in me and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
I am the vine you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing.
If anyone does not remain in me he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers such branches are picked up thrown into the fire and burned.
If you remain in me and my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be given you.
This is to my Fathers glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples.
As the Father has loved me so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.
If you obey my commands you will remain in my love just as I have obeyed my Fathers commands and remain in his love.
I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.
My command is this Love each other as I have loved you.
Greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command.
I no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his masters business. Instead I have called you friends for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.
You did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruitfruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
This is my command Love each other.
If the world hates you keep in mind that it hated me first.
If you belonged to the world it would love you as its own. As it is you do not belong to the world but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.
Remember the words I spoke to you No servant is greater than his master. If they persecuted me they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching they will obey yours also.
They will treat you this way because of my name for they do not know the One who sent me.
If I had not come and spoken to them they would not be guilty of sin. Now however they have no excuse for their sin.
He who hates me hates my Father as well.
If I had not done among them what no one else did they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles and yet they have hated both me and my Father.
But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law They hated me without reason.
When the Counselor comes whom I will send to you from the Father the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father he will testify about me.
And you also must testify for you have been with me from the beginning.
All this I have told you so that you will not go astray.
They will put you out of the synagogue in fact a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God.
They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.
I have told you this so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you this at first because I was with you.
Now I am going to him who sent me yet none of you asks me Where are you going?
Because I have said these things you are filled with grief.
But I tell you the truth It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away the Counselor will not come to you but if I go I will send him to you.
When he comes he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment
in regard to sin because men do not believe in me
in regard to righteousness because I am going to the Father where you can see me no longer
and in regard to judgment because the prince of this world now stands condemned.
I have much more to say to you more than you can now bear.
But when he the Spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is yet to come.
He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.
All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.
In a little while you will see me no more and then after a little while you will see me.
Some of his disciples said to one another What does he mean by saying In a little while you will see me no more and then after a little while you will see me and Because I am going to the Father?
They kept asking What does he mean by a little while? We dont understand what he is saying.
Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this so he said to them Are you asking one another what I meant when I said In a little while you will see me no more and then after a little while you will see me?
I tell you the truth you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve but your grief will turn to joy.
A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.
So with you Now is your time of grief but I will see you again and you will rejoice and no one will take away your joy.
In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive and your joy will be complete.
Though I have been speaking figuratively a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.
After Jesus said this he looked toward heaven and prayed Father the time has come. Glorify your Son that your Son may glorify you.
For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
Now this is eternal life that they may know you the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.
And now Father glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.
I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.
Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you and they believed that you sent me.
I pray for them. I am not praying for the world but for those you have given me for they are yours.
All I have is yours and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.
I will remain in the world no longer but they are still in the world and I am coming to you. Holy Father protect them by the power of your namethe name you gave meso that they may be one as we are one.
While I was with them I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
I am coming to you now but I say these things while I am still in the world so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.
I have given them your word and the world has hated them for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.
My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.
They are not of the world even as I am not of it.
Sanctify them by the truth your word is truth.
As you sent me into the world I have sent them into the world.
For them I sanctify myself that they too may be truly sanctified.
My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message
that all of them may be one Father just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
I have given them the glory that you gave me that they may be one as we are one
I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
Father I want those you have given me to be with me where I am and to see my glory the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.
Righteous Father though the world does not know you I know you and they know that you have sent me.
I have made you known to them and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.
When he had finished praying Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove and he and his disciples went into it.
Now Judas who betrayed him knew the place because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
So Judas came to the grove guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches lanterns and weapons.
Jesus knowing all that was going to happen to him went out and asked them Who is it you want?
Jesus of Nazareth they replied. I am he Jesus said.
When Jesus said I am he they drew back and fell to the ground.
Again he asked them Who is it you want? And they said Jesus of Nazareth.
I told you that I am he Jesus answered. If you are looking for me then let these men go.
This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled I have not lost one of those you gave me.
Then Simon Peter who had a sword drew it and struck the high priests servant cutting off his right ear.
Jesus commanded Peter Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?
Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him
and brought him first to Annas who was the fatherinlaw of Caiaphas the high priest that year.
Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.
Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest he went with Jesus into the high priests courtyard
but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple who was known to the high priest came back spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.
You are not one of his disciples are you? the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied I am not.
It was cold and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them warming himself.
Meanwhile the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
I have spoken openly to the world Jesus replied. I always taught in synagogues or at the temple where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.
Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.
When Jesus said this one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. Is this the way you answer the high priest? he demanded.
If I said something wrong Jesus replied testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth why did you strike me?
Then Annas sent him still bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
As Simon Peter stood warming himself he was asked You are not one of his disciples are you? He denied it saying I am not.
One of the high priests servants a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off challenged him Didnt I see you with him in the olive grove?
Again Peter denied it and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
So Pilate came out to them and asked What charges are you bringing against this man?
If he were not a criminal they replied we would not have handed him over to you.
Pilate said Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law. But we have no right to execute anyone the Jews objected.
This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.
Pilate then went back inside the palace summoned Jesus and asked him Are you the king of the Jews?
Is that your own idea Jesus asked or did others talk to you about me?
Am I a Jew? Pilate replied. It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?
Jesus said My kingdom is not of this world. If it were my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.
You are a king then! said Pilate. Jesus answered You are right in saying I am a king. In fact for this reason I was born and for this I came into the world to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.
What is truth? Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said I find no basis for a charge against him.
But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release the king of the Jews?
They shouted back No not him! Give us Barabbas! Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.
Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe
and went up to him again and again saying Hail king of the Jews! And they struck him in the face.
Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews Look I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.
When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe Pilate said to them Here is the man!
As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him they shouted Crucify! Crucify! But Pilate answered You take him and crucify him. As for me I find no basis for a charge against him.
The Jews insisted We have a law and according to that law he must die because he claimed to be the Son of God.
When Pilate heard this he was even more afraid
and he went back inside the palace. Where do you come from? he asked Jesus but Jesus gave him no answer.
Do you refuse to speak to me? Pilate said. Dont you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?
Jesus answered You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.
From then on Pilate tried to set Jesus free but the Jews kept shouting If you let this man go you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.
When Pilate heard this he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judges seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement .
It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week about the sixth hour. Here is your king Pilate said to the Jews.
But they shouted Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him! Shall I crucify your king? Pilate asked. We have no king but Caesar the chief priests answered.
Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.
Carrying his own cross he went out to the place of the Skull .
Here they crucified him and with him two othersone on each side and Jesus in the middle.
Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Many of the Jews read this sign for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city and the sign was written in Aramaic Latin and Greek.
The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate Do not write The King of the Jews but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.
Pilate answered What I have written I have written.
When the soldiers crucified Jesus they took his clothes dividing them into four shares one for each of them with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless woven in one piece from top to bottom.
Lets not tear it they said to one another. Lets decide by lot who will get it. This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. So this is what the soldiers did.
Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother his mothers sister Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.
When Jesus saw his mother there and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby he said to his mother Dear woman here is your son
and to the disciple Here is your mother. From that time on this disciple took her into his home.
Later knowing that all was now completed and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled Jesus said I am thirsty.
A jar of wine vinegar was there so they soaked a sponge in it put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus lips.
When he had received the drink Jesus said It is finished. With that he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
Early on the first day of the week while it was still dark Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple the one Jesus loved and said They have taken the Lord out of the tomb and we dont know where they have put him!
So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
Both were running but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.
Then Simon Peter who was behind him arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there
as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus head. The cloth was folded up by itself separate from the linen.
Finally the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went inside. He saw and believed.

Then the disciples went back to their homes
but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept she bent over to look into the tomb
and saw two angels in white seated where Jesus body had been one at the head and the other at the foot.
They asked her Woman why are you crying? They have taken my Lord away she said and I dont know where they have put him.
At this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there but she did not realize that it was Jesus.
Woman he said why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for? Thinking he was the gardener she said Sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have put him and I will get him.
Jesus said to her Mary. She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic Rabboni! .
Jesus said Do not hold on to me for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them I am returning to my Father and your Father to my God and your God. 
Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news I have seen the Lord! And she told them that he had said these things to her.
On the evening of that first day of the week when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood among them and said Peace be with you!
After he said this he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
Again Jesus said Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me I am sending you.
And with that he breathed on them and said Receive the Holy Spirit.
If you forgive anyone his sins they are forgiven if you do not forgive them they are not forgiven.
Now Thomas  one of the Twelve was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way
Simon Peter Thomas  Nathanael from Cana in Galilee the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples were together.
Im going out to fish Simon Peter told them and they said Well go with you. So they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing.
Early in the morning Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
He called out to them Friends havent you any fish? No they answered.
He said Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some. When they did they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter It is the Lord! As soon as Simon Peter heard him say It is the Lord he wrapped his outer garment around him  and jumped into the water.
The other disciples followed in the boat towing the net full of fish for they were not far from shore about a hundred yards.
When they landed they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it and some bread.
Jesus said to them Bring some of the fish you have just caught.
Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish 153 but even with so many the net was not torn.
Jesus said to them Come and have breakfast. None of the disciples dared ask him Who are you? They knew it was the Lord.
Jesus came took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish.
This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
When they had finished eating Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of John do you truly love me more than these? Yes Lord he said you know that I love you. Jesus said Feed my lambs.
Again Jesus said Simon son of John do you truly love me? He answered Yes Lord you know that I love you. Jesus said Take care of my sheep.
The third time he said to him Simon son of John do you love me? Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time Do you love me? He said Lord you know all things you know that I love you. Jesus said Feed my sheep.
I tell you the truth when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted but when you are old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.
Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him Follow me!
Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them.
When Peter saw him he asked Lord what about him?
Jesus answered If I want him to remain alive until I return what is that to you? You must follow me.
Because of this the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die he only said If I want him to remain alive until I return what is that to you?
This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
In my former book Theophilus I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach
until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
After his suffering he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
On one occasion while he was eating with them he gave them this command Do not leave Jerusalem but wait for the gift my Father promised which you have heard me speak about.
For John baptized with water but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
So when they met together they asked him Lord are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
He said to them It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.
After he said this he was taken up before their very eyes and a cloud hid him from their sight.
They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
Men of Galilee they said why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives a Sabbath days walk from the city.
When they arrived they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter John James and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartholomew and Matthew James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James.
They all joined together constantly in prayer along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.
In those days Peter stood up among the believers
and said Brothers the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus
he was one of our number and shared in this ministry.
(With the reward he got for his wickedness Judas bought a field there he fell headlong his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.
Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this so they called that field in their language Akeldama that is Field of Blood.)
For said Peter it is written in the book of Psalms  May his place be deserted let there be no one to dwell in it and  May another take his place of leadership.
Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us
beginning from Johns baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.
So they proposed two men Joseph called Barsabbas  and Matthias.
Then they prayed Lord you know everyones heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen
to take over this apostolic ministry which Judas left to go where he belongs.
Then they cast lots and the lot fell to Matthias so he was added to the eleven apostles.
When the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place.
Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
Now there were staying in Jerusalem Godfearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
When they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
Utterly amazed they asked Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?
Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language?
Parthians Medes and Elamites residents of Mesopotamia Judea and Cappadocia Pontus and Asia
Phrygia and Pamphylia Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene visitors from Rome
 Cretans and Arabswe hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!
Amazed and perplexed they asked one another What does this mean?
Some however made fun of them and said They have had too much wine. 
Then Peter stood up with the Eleven raised his voice and addressed the crowd Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem let me explain this to you listen carefully to what I say.
These men are not drunk as you suppose. Its only nine in the morning!
No this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel
 In the last days God says I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams.
Even on my servants both men and women I will pour out my Spirit in those days and they will prophesy.
I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below blood and fire and billows of smoke.
The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
Men of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles wonders and signs which God did among you through him as you yourselves know.
This man was handed over to you by Gods set purpose and foreknowledge and you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
But God raised him from the dead freeing him from the agony of death because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
David said about him  I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand I will not be shaken.
One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayerat three in the afternoon.
Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.
When he saw Peter and John about to enter he asked them for money.
Peter looked straight at him as did John. Then Peter said Look at us!
So the man gave them his attention expecting to get something from them.
Then Peter said Silver or gold I do not have but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth walk.
Taking him by the right hand he helped him up and instantly the mans feet and ankles became strong.
He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts walking and jumping and praising God.
When all the people saw him walking and praising God
they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
While the beggar held on to Peter and John all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomons Colonnade.
When Peter saw this he said to them Men of Israel why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
The God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the God of our fathers has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed and you disowned him before Pilate though he had decided to let him go.
You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.
You killed the author of life but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.
By faith in the name of Jesus this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus name and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him as you can all see.
Now brothers I know that you acted in ignorance as did your leaders.
But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets saying that his Christ would suffer.
Repent then and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out that times of refreshing may come from the Lord
and that he may send the Christ who has been appointed for youeven Jesus.
He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.
For Moses said The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people you must listen to everything he tells you.
Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people.
Indeed all the prophets from Samuel on as many as have spoken have foretold these days.
And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.
When God raised up his servant he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.
The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
They seized Peter and John and because it was evening they put them in jail until the next day.
But many who heard the message believed and the number of men grew to about five thousand.
The next day the rulers elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
Annas the high priest was there and so were Caiaphas John Alexander and the other men of the high priests family.
They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them By what power or what name did you do this?
Then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit said to them Rulers and elders of the people!
If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed
then know this you and all the people of Israel It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead that this man stands before you healed.
He is  the stone you builders rejected which has become the capstone. 
Salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.
When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them there was nothing they could say.
So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.
What are we going to do with these men? they asked. Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle and we cannot deny it.
But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name.
Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
But Peter and John replied Judge for yourselves whether it is right in Gods sight to obey you rather than God.
For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.
After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
On their release Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
When they heard this they raised their voices together in prayer to God. Sovereign Lord they said you made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant our father David  Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One. 
Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed.
They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
Now Lord consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.
After they prayed the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own but they shared everything they had.
With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and much grace was upon them all.
There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them brought the money from the sales
and put it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to anyone as he had need.
Joseph a Levite from Cyprus whom the apostles called Barnabas 
sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles feet.
Now a man named Ananias together with his wife Sapphira also sold a piece of property.
With his wifes full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself but brought the rest and put it at the apostles feet.
Then Peter said Ananias how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?
Didnt it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold wasnt the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.
When Ananias heard this he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened.
Then the young men came forward wrapped up his body and carried him out and buried him.
About three hours later his wife came in not knowing what had happened.
Peter asked her Tell me is this the price you and Ananias got for the land? Yes she said that is the price.
Peter said to her How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out also.
At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and finding her dead carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.
The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomons Colonnade.
No one else dared join them even though they were highly regarded by the people.
Nevertheless more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.
In those days when the number of disciples was increasing the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.
Brothers choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them
and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.
This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit also Philip Procorus Nicanor Timon Parmenas and Nicolas from Antioch a convert to Judaism.
They presented these men to the apostles who prayed and laid their hands on them.
So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
Now Stephen a man full of Gods grace and power did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.
Opposition arose however from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These men began to argue with Stephen
but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke.
Then they secretly persuaded some men to say We have heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.
So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
They produced false witnesses who testified This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law.
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.
All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
Then the high priest asked him Are these charges true?
To this he replied Brothers and fathers listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran.
Leave your country and your people God said and go to the land I will show you.
So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the death of his father God sent him to this land where you are now living.
He gave him no inheritance here not even a foot of ground. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land even though at that time Abraham had no child.
God spoke to him in this way Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves God said and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.
Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him
and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt so he made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace.
Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan bringing great suffering and our fathers could not find food.
When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt he sent our fathers on their first visit.
On their second visit Joseph told his brothers who he was and Pharaoh learned about Josephs family.
After this Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family seventyfive in all.
Then Jacob went down to Egypt where he and our fathers died.
Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.
As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased.
Then another king who knew nothing about Joseph became ruler of Egypt.
He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.
At that time Moses was born and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for in his fathers house.
When he was placed outside Pharaohs daughter took him and brought him up as her own son.
Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.
When Moses was forty years old he decided to visit his fellow Israelites.
He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian.
Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them but they did not.
The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying Men you are brothers why do you want to hurt each other?
But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said Who made you ruler and judge over us?
Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?
When Moses heard this he fled to Midian where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons.
After forty years had passed an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
When he saw this he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely he heard the Lords voice
I am the God of your fathers the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.
Then the Lord said to him Take off your sandals the place where you are standing is holy ground.
I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come I will send you back to Egypt.
This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words Who made you ruler and judge? He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
He was in the assembly in the desert with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our fathers and he received living words to pass on to us.
But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
And Saul was there giving approval to his death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.
Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.
When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did they all paid close attention to what he said.
With shrieks evil spirits came out of many and many paralytics and cripples were healed.
So there was great joy in that city.
Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great
and all the people both high and low gave him their attention and exclaimed This man is the divine power known as the Great Power.
They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.
But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women.
Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.
When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God they sent Peter and John to them.
When they arrived they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit
because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Then Peter and John placed their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.
When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money
and said Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.
Peter answered May your money perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!
You have no part or share in this ministry because your heart is not right before God.
Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.
For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.
Then Simon answered Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.
When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord Peter and John returned to Jerusalem preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip Go south to the roadthe desert roadthat goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
So he started out and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship
and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet.
The Spirit told Philip Go to that chariot and stay near it.
Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. Do you understand what you are reading? Philip asked.
How can I he said unless someone explains it to me? So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture He was led like a sheep to the slaughter and as a lamb before the shearer is silent so he did not open his mouth.
In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.
The eunuch asked Philip Tell me please who is the prophet talking about himself or someone else?
Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
As they traveled along the road they came to some water and the eunuch said Look here is water. Why shouldnt I be baptized?
And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
When they came up out of the water the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away and the eunuch did not see him again but went on his way rejoicing.
Philip however appeared at Azotus and traveled about preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
Meanwhile Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lords disciples. He went to the high priest
and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way whether men or women he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
As he neared Damascus on his journey suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him Saul Saul why do you persecute me?
Who are you Lord? Saul asked. I am Jesus whom you are persecuting he replied.
Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.
The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless they heard the sound but did not see anyone.
Saul got up from the ground but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
For three days he was blind and did not eat or drink anything.
In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision Ananias! Yes Lord he answered.
The Lord told him Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul for he is praying.
In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.
Lord Ananias answered I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.
And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.
But the Lord said to Ananias Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.
I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.
Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul he said Brother Saul the LordJesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming herehas sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
Immediately something like scales fell from Sauls eyes and he could see again. He got up and was baptized
and after taking some food he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
All those who heard him were astonished and asked Isnt he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasnt he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?
Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.
After many days had gone by the Jews conspired to kill him
but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.
But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
When he came to Jerusalem he tried to join the disciples but they were all afraid of him not believing that he really was a disciple.
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews but they tried to kill him.
When the brothers learned of this they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
Then the church throughout Judea Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened and encouraged by the Holy Spirit it grew in numbers living in the fear of the Lord.
As Peter traveled about the country he went to visit the saints in Lydda.
There he found a man named Aeneas a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years.
Aeneas Peter said to him Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat. Immediately Aeneas got up.
All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha  who was always doing good and helping the poor.
About that time she became sick and died and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.
Lydda was near Joppa so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda they sent two men to him and urged him Please come at once!
Peter went with them and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
Peter sent them all out of the room then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman he said Tabitha get up. She opened her eyes and seeing Peter she sat up.
He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive.
This became known all over Joppa and many people believed in the Lord.
Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
He and all his family were devout and Godfearing he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.
One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him and said Cornelius!
Cornelius stared at him in fear. What is it Lord? he asked. The angel answered Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.
Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.
He is staying with Simon the tanner whose house is by the sea.
When the angel who spoke to him had gone Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.
He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.
About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city Peter went up on the roof to pray.
He became hungry and wanted something to eat and while the meal was being prepared he fell into a trance.
He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.
It contained all kinds of fourfooted animals as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.
Then a voice told him Get up Peter. Kill and eat.
Surely not Lord! Peter replied. I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.
The voice spoke to him a second time Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.
This happened three times and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simons house was and stopped at the gate.
They called out asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.
While Peter was still thinking about the vision the Spirit said to him Simon three men are looking for you.
So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them for I have sent them.
Peter went down and said to the men Im the one youre looking for. Why have you come?
The men replied We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and Godfearing man who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.
Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them and some of the brothers from Joppa went along.
The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
As Peter entered the house Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
But Peter made him get up. Stand up he said I am only a man myself.
Talking with him Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
He said to them You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.
So when I was sent for I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?
The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
So when Peter went up to Jerusalem the circumcised believers criticized him
and said You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.
Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened
I was in the city of Joppa praying and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners and it came down to where I was.
I looked into it and saw fourfooted animals of the earth wild beasts reptiles and birds of the air.
Then I heard a voice telling me Get up Peter. Kill and eat.
I replied Surely not Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.
The voice spoke from heaven a second time Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.
This happened three times and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.
Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.
The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me and we entered the mans house.
He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.
As I began to speak the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.
Then I remembered what the Lord had said John baptized with water but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ who was I to think that I could oppose God?
When they heard this they had no further objections and praised God saying So then God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.
Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia Cyprus and Antioch telling the message only to Jews.
Some of them however men from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
The Lords hand was with them and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
He was a good man full of the Holy Spirit and faith and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church intending to persecute them.
He had James the brother of John put to death with the sword.
When he saw that this pleased the Jews he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
After arresting him he put him in prison handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.
So Peter was kept in prison but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.
The night before Herod was to bring him to trial Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and sentries stood guard at the entrance.
Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. Quick get up! he said and the chains fell off Peters wrists.
Then the angel said to him Put on your clothes and sandals. And Peter did so. Wrap your cloak around you and follow me the angel told him.
Peter followed him out of the prison but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening he thought he was seeing a vision.
They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street suddenly the angel left him.
Then Peter came to himself and said Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herods clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating.
When this had dawned on him he went to the house of Mary the mother of John also called Mark where many people had gathered and were praying.
Peter knocked at the outer entrance and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door.
When she recognized Peters voice she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed Peter is at the door!
Youre out of your mind they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so they said It must be his angel.
But Peter kept on knocking and when they opened the door and saw him they were astonished.
Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. Tell James and the brothers about this he said and then he left for another place.
In the morning there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him he crossexamined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while.
He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon they now joined together and sought an audience with him. Having secured the support of Blastus a trusted personal servant of the king they asked for peace because they depended on the kings country for their food supply.
On the appointed day Herod wearing his royal robes sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.
They shouted This is the voice of a god not of a man.
Immediately because Herod did not give praise to God an angel of the Lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died.
But the word of God continued to increase and spread.
When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission they returned from Jerusalem taking with them John also called Mark.
In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers Barnabas Simeon called Niger Lucius of Cyrene Manaen  and Saul.
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting the Holy Spirit said Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
So after they had fasted and prayed they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
The two of them sent on their way by the Holy Spirit went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.
When they arrived at Salamis they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.
They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named BarJesus
who was an attendant of the proconsul Sergius Paulus. The proconsul an intelligent man sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
But Elymas the sorcerer  opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
Then Saul who was also called Paul filled with the Holy Spirit looked straight at Elymas and said
You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun. Immediately mist and darkness came over him and he groped about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
When the proconsul saw what had happened he believed for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
From Paphos Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down.
After the reading from the Law and the Prophets the synagogue rulers sent word to them saying Brothers if you have a message of encouragement for the people please speak.
Standing up Paul motioned with his hand and said Men of Israel and you Gentiles who worship God listen to me!
The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt with mighty power he led them out of that country
he endured their conduct for about forty years in the desert
he overthrew seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance.
All this took about 450 years. After this God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
Then the people asked for a king and he gave them Saul son of Kish of the tribe of Benjamin who ruled forty years.
After removing Saul he made David their king. He testified concerning him I have found David son of Jesse a man after my own heart he will do everything I want him to do.
From this mans descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus as he promised.
Before the coming of Jesus John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.
As John was completing his work he said Who do you think I am? I am not that one. No but he is coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.
Brothers children of Abraham and you Godfearing Gentiles it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.
The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Gentiles believed.
But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there speaking boldly for the Lord who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders.
The people of the city were divided some sided with the Jews others with the apostles.
There was a plot afoot among the Gentiles and Jews together with their leaders to mistreat them and stone them.
But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country
where they continued to preach the good news.
In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet who was lame from birth and had never walked.
He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him saw that he had faith to be healed
and called out Stand up on your feet! At that the man jumped up and began to walk.
When the crowd saw what Paul had done they shouted in the Lycaonian language The gods have come down to us in human form!
Barnabas they called Zeus and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.
The priest of Zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd shouting
Men why are you doing this? We too are only men human like you. We are bringing you good news telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them.
In the past he let all nations go their own way.
Yet he has not left himself without testimony He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.
Even with these words they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.
Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city thinking he was dead.
But after the disciples had gathered around him he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
They preached the good news in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra Iconium and Antioch
strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God they said.
Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and with prayer and fasting committed them to the Lord in whom they had put their trust.
After going through Pisidia they came into Pamphylia
and when they had preached the word in Perga they went down to Attalia.
From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
On arriving there they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers Unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by Moses you cannot be saved.
This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed along with some other believers to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.
The church sent them on their way and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad.
When they came to Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders to whom they reported everything God had done through them.
Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses.
The apostles and elders met to consider this question.
After much discussion Peter got up and addressed them Brothers you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.
God who knows the heart showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them just as he did to us.
He made no distinction between us and them for he purified their hearts by faith.
Now then why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?
No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved just as they are.
The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
When they finished James spoke up Brothers listen to me.
Simon has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself.
The words of the prophets are in agreement with this as it is written
 After this I will return and rebuild Davids fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild and I will restore it
that the remnant of men may seek the Lord and all the Gentiles who bear my name says the Lord who does these things
that have been known for ages.
It is my judgment therefore that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
Instead we should write to them telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols from sexual immorality from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.
For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.
Then the apostles and elders with the whole church decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas  and Silas two men who were leaders among the brothers.
With them they sent the following letter The apostles and elders your brothers To the Gentile believers in Antioch Syria and Cilicia Greetings.
We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you troubling your minds by what they said.
So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul
men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements
You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols from blood from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.
The men were sent off and went down to Antioch where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.
The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.
Judas and Silas who themselves were prophets said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.
After spending some time there they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.
But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.
Some time later Paul said to Barnabas Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.
Barnabas wanted to take John also called Mark with them
but Paul did not think it wise to take him because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus
but Paul chose Silas and left commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
He went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches.
He came to Derbe and then to Lystra where a disciple named Timothy lived whose mother was a Jewess and a believer but whose father was a Greek.
The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.
Paul wanted to take him along on the journey so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
As they traveled from town to town they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.
So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.
When they came to the border of Mysia they tried to enter Bithynia but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.
During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him Come over to Macedonia and help us.
After Paul had seen the vision we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace and the next day on to Neapolis.
From there we traveled to Philippi a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.
On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.
One of those listening was a woman named Lydia a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Pauls message.
When she and the members of her household were baptized she invited us to her home. If you consider me a believer in the Lord she said come and stay at my house. And she persuaded us.
Once when we were going to the place of prayer we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortunetelling.
This girl followed Paul and the rest of us shouting These men are servants of the Most High God who are telling you the way to be saved.
She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her! At that moment the spirit left her.
When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
They brought them before the magistrates and said These men are Jews and are throwing our city into an uproar
by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.
The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten.
After they had been severely flogged they were thrown into prison and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
Upon receiving such orders he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and the other prisoners were listening to them.
Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open and everybodys chains came loose.
The jailer woke up and when he saw the prison doors open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
But Paul shouted Dont harm yourself! We are all here!
The jailer called for lights rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
He then brought them out and asked Sirs what must I do to be saved?
They replied Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be savedyou and your household.
Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds then immediately he and all his family were baptized.
When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica where there was a Jewish synagogue.
As his custom was Paul went into the synagogue and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures
explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ  he said.
Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas as did a large number of Godfearing Greeks and not a few prominent women.
But the Jews were jealous so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jasons house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.
But when they did not find them they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials shouting These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here
and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesars decrees saying that there is another king one called Jesus.
When they heard this the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.
Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.
As soon as it was night the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there they went to the Jewish synagogue.
Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
Many of the Jews believed as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.
When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea they went there too agitating the crowds and stirring them up.
The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.
The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
While Paul was waiting for them in Athens he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the Godfearing Greeks as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.
A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked What is this babbler trying to say? Others remarked He seems to be advocating foreign gods. They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus where they said to him May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears and we want to know what they mean.

Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship I even found an altar with this inscription TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.
The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.
And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.
From one man he made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.
God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him though he is not far from each one of us.
After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
There he met a Jew named Aquila a native of Pontus who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them
and because he was a tentmaker as they were he stayed and worked with them.
Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.
Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus a worshiper of God.
Crispus the synagogue ruler and his entire household believed in the Lord and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.
One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision Do not be afraid keep on speaking do not be silent.
For I am with you and no one is going to attack and harm you because I have many people in this city.
So Paul stayed for a year and a half teaching them the word of God.
While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court.
This man they charged is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.
Just as Paul was about to speak Gallio said to the Jews If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.
But since it involves questions about words and names and your own lawsettle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.
So he had them ejected from the court.
Then they all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever.
Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken.
They arrived at Ephesus where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
When they asked him to spend more time with them he declined.
But as he left he promised I will come back if it is Gods will. Then he set sail from Ephesus.
When he landed at Caesarea he went up and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.
After spending some time in Antioch Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples.
Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos a native of Alexandria came to Ephesus. He was a learned man with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.
He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately though he knew only the baptism of John.
He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.
When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.
For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
While Apollos was at Corinth Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples
and asked them Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? They answered No we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.
So Paul asked Then what baptism did you receive? Johns baptism they replied.
Paul said Johns baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him that is in Jesus.
On hearing this they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
When Paul placed his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
There were about twelve men in all.
Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.
But some of them became obstinate they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
This went on for two years so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.
God did extraordinary miracles through Paul
so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demonpossessed. They would say In the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches I command you to come out.
Seven sons of Sceva a Jewish chief priest were doing this.
One day the evil spirit answered them Jesus I know and I know about Paul but who are you?
Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.
When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus they were all seized with fear and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds.
A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.
In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
After all this had happened Paul decided to go to Jerusalem passing through Macedonia and Achaia. After I have been there he said I must visit Rome also.
He sent two of his helpers Timothy and Erastus to Macedonia while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.
About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.
A silversmith named Demetrius who made silver shrines of Artemis brought in no little business for the craftsmen.
He called them together along with the workmen in related trades and said Men you know we receive a good income from this business.
And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that manmade gods are no gods at all.
There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited and the goddess herself who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world will be robbed of her divine majesty.
When they heard this they were furious and began shouting Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus Pauls traveling companions from Macedonia and rushed as one man into the theater.
Paul wanted to appear before the crowd but the disciples would not let him.
Even some of the officials of the province friends of Paul sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.
The assembly was in confusion Some were shouting one thing some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.
The Jews pushed Alexander to the front and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people.
But when they realized he was a Jew they all shouted in unison for about two hours Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
The city clerk quieted the crowd and said Men of Ephesus doesnt all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image which fell from heaven?
Therefore since these facts are undeniable you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash.
You have brought these men here though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
When the uproar had ended Paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them said goodby and set out for Macedonia.
He traveled through that area speaking many words of encouragement to the people and finally arrived in Greece
where he stayed three months. Because the Jews made a plot against him just as he was about to sail for Syria he decided to go back through Macedonia.
He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica Gaius from Derbe Timothy also and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.
These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
But we sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread and five days later joined the others at Troas where we stayed seven days.
On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and because he intended to leave the next day kept on talking until midnight.
There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.
Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead.
Paul went down threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. Dont be alarmed he said. Hes alive!
Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight he left.
The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.
When he met us at Assos we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Kios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos and on the following day arrived at Miletus.
Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem if possible by the day of Pentecost.
From Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.
When they arrived he said to them You know how I lived the whole time I was with you from the first day I came into the province of Asia.
I served the Lord with great humility and with tears although I was severely tested by the plots of the Jews.
You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.
I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
And now compelled by the Spirit I am going to Jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there.
I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.
However I consider my life worth nothing to me if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given methe task of testifying to the gospel of Gods grace.
Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.
Therefore I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God which he bought with his own blood.
I know that after I leave savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.
So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
I have not coveted anyones silver or gold or clothing.
You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.
In everything I did I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said It is more blessed to give than to receive. 
When he had said this he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.
What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
After we had torn ourselves away from them we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.
We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia went on board and set sail.
After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre where our ship was to unload its cargo.
Finding the disciples there we stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
But when our time was up we left and continued on our way. All the disciples and their wives and children accompanied us out of the city and there on the beach we knelt to pray.
After saying goodby to each other we went aboard the ship and they returned home.
We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day.
Leaving the next day we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist one of the Seven.
He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
After we had been there a number of days a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
Coming over to us he took Pauls belt tied his own hands and feet with it and said The Holy Spirit says In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles. 
When we heard this we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
Then Paul answered Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
When he would not be dissuaded we gave up and said The Lords will be done.
After this we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.
When we arrived at Jerusalem the brothers received us warmly.
The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James and all the elders were present.
Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
When they heard this they praised God. Then they said to Paul You see brother how many thousands of Jews have believed and all of them are zealous for the law.
They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.
What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come
so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.
Take these men join in their purification rites and pay their expenses so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody will know there is no truth in these reports about you but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.
As for the Gentile believers we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols from blood from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.
The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.
When the seven days were nearly over some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him
shouting Men of Israel help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place.

Brothers and fathers listen now to my defense.
When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic they became very quiet. Then Paul said
I am a Jew born in Tarsus of Cilicia but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.
I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison
as also the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.
About noon as I came near Damascus suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.
I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?
 Who are you Lord? I asked.  I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting he replied.
My companions saw the light but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.
 What shall I do Lord? I asked.  Get up the Lord said and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.
My companions led me by the hand into Damascus because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.
A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.
He stood beside me and said Brother Saul receive your sight! And at that very moment I was able to see him.
Then he said The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.
You will be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
And now what are you waiting for? Get up be baptized and wash your sins away calling on his name.
When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple I fell into a trance
and saw the Lord speaking. Quick! he said to me. Leave Jerusalem immediately because they will not accept your testimony about me.
 Lord I replied these men know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you.
And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.
Then the Lord said to me Go I will send you far away to the Gentiles. 
The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted Rid the earth of him! Hes not fit to live!
As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air
the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.
As they stretched him out to flog him Paul said to the centurion standing there Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasnt even been found guilty?
When the centurion heard this he went to the commander and reported it. What are you going to do? he asked. This man is a Roman citizen.
The commander went to Paul and asked Tell me are you a Roman citizen? Yes I am he answered.
Then the commander said I had to pay a big price for my citizenship. But I was born a citizen Paul replied.
Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul a Roman citizen in chains.
The next day since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.
Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said My brothers I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.
At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
Then Paul said to him God will strike you you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!
Those who were standing near Paul said You dare to insult Gods high priest?
Paul replied Brothers I did not realize that he was the high priest for it is written Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people. 

There was a great uproar and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. We find nothing wrong with this man they said. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?
The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.
The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem so you must also testify in Rome.
The next morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
More than forty men were involved in this plot.
They went to the chief priests and elders and said We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.
Now then you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.
But when the son of Pauls sister heard of this plot he went into the barracks and told Paul.
Then Paul called one of the centurions and said Take this young man to the commander he has something to tell him.
So he took him to the commander. The centurion said Paul the prisoner sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.
The commander took the young man by the hand drew him aside and asked What is it you want to tell me?
He said The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.
Dont give in to them because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now waiting for your consent to their request.
The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him Dont tell anyone that you have reported this to me.
Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.
He wrote a letter as follows
Claudius Lysias To His Excellency Governor Felix Greetings.
Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.
When Paul was called in Tertullus presented his case before Felix We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.
Everywhere and in every way most excellent Felix we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.
But in order not to weary you further I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.
We have found this man to be a troublemaker stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect
and even tried to desecrate the temple so we seized him.
By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.
The Jews joined in the accusation asserting that these things were true.
When the governor motioned for him to speak Paul replied I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation so I gladly make my defense.
You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.
And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.
However I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets
and I have the same hope in God as these men that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
After an absence of several years I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.
I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me nor was I involved in any disturbance.
But there are some Jews from the province of Asia who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.
Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin
unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today. 
Then Felix who was well acquainted with the Way adjourned the proceedings. When Lysias the commander comes he said I will decide your case.
He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
As Paul discoursed on righteousness selfcontrol and the judgment to come Felix was afraid and said Thats enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient I will send for you.
At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.
When two years had passed Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews he left Paul in prison.
Three days after arriving in the province Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem
where the chief priests and Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.
They urgently requested Festus as a favor to them to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.
Festus answered Paul is being held at Caesarea and I myself am going there soon.
Let some of your leaders come with me and press charges against the man there if he has done anything wrong.
After spending eight or ten days with them he went down to Caesarea and the next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.
When Paul appeared the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove.
Then Paul made his defense I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar.
Festus wishing to do the Jews a favor said to Paul Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?
Paul answered I am now standing before Caesars court where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews as you yourself know very well.
If however I am guilty of doing anything deserving death I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!
After Festus had conferred with his council he declared You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!
A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
Since they were spending many days there Festus discussed Pauls case with the king. He said There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.
When I went to Jerusalem the chief priests and elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.
I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over any man before he has faced his accusers and has had an opportunity to defend himself against their charges.
When they came here with me I did not delay the case but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.
When his accusers got up to speak they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.
Instead they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive.
I was at a loss how to investigate such matters so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.
When Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperors decision I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.
Then Agrippa said to Festus I would like to hear this man myself. He replied Tomorrow you will hear him.
The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus Paul was brought in.
Festus said King Agrippa and all who are present with us you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
I found he had done nothing deserving of death but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.
But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you and especially before you King Agrippa so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.
For I think it is unreasonable to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.
Then Agrippa said to Paul You have permission to speak for yourself. So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense
King Agrippa I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews
and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child from the beginning of my life in my own country and also in Jerusalem.
They have known me for a long time and can testify if they are willing that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.
And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.
This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.
Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison and when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.
Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.
On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
About noon O king as I was on the road I saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun blazing around me and my companions.
We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic Saul Saul why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
Then I asked Who are you Lord?  I am Jesus whom you are persecuting the Lord replied.
Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.
I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them
to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.
So then King Agrippa I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.
First to those in Damascus then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea and to the Gentiles also I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.
That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.
But I have had Gods help to this very day and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen
that the Christ would suffer and as the first to rise from the dead would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles.
At this point Festus interrupted Pauls defense. You are out of your mind Paul! he shouted. Your great learning is driving you insane.
I am not insane most excellent Festus Paul replied. What I am saying is true and reasonable.
The king is familiar with these things and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice because it was not done in a corner.
King Agrippa do you believe the prophets? I know you do.
Then Agrippa said to Paul Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?
Paul replied Short time or longI pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am except for these chains.
The king rose and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.
They left the room and while talking with one another they said This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.
Agrippa said to Festus This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.
When it was decided that we would sail for Italy Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.
We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia and we put out to sea. Aristarchus a Macedonian from Thessalonica was with us.
The next day we landed at Sidon and Julius in kindness to Paul allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.
From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia we landed at Myra in Lycia.
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course we sailed to the lee of Crete opposite Salmone.
We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens near the town of Lasea.
Much time had been lost and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. So Paul warned them
Men I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo and to our own lives also.
But the centurion instead of listening to what Paul said followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.
Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in the majority decided that we should sail on hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete facing both southwest and northwest.
When a gentle south wind began to blow they thought they had obtained what they wanted so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
Before very long a wind of hurricane force called the northeaster swept down from the island.
The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind so we gave way to it and were driven along.
As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure.
When the men had hoisted it aboard they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.
We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.
On the third day they threw the ships tackle overboard with their own hands.
When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
After the men had gone a long time without food Paul stood up before them and said Men you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.
But now I urge you to keep up your courage because not one of you will be lost only the ship will be destroyed.
Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me
and said Do not be afraid Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.
So keep up your courage men for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.
Nevertheless we must run aground on some island.
On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
In an attempt to escape from the ship the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.
Once safely on shore we found out that the island was called Malta.
The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.
Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and as he put it on the fire a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand.
When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand they said to each other This man must be a murderer for though he escaped from the sea Justice has not allowed him to live.
But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.
The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him they changed their minds and said he was a god.
There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and for three days entertained us hospitably.
His father was sick in bed suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and after prayer placed his hands on him and healed him.
When this had happened the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.
They honored us in many ways and when we were ready to sail they furnished us with the supplies we needed.
After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island. It was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.
We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.
From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up and on the following day we reached Puteoli.
There we found some brothers who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.
The brothers there had heard that we were coming and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged.
When we got to Rome Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier to guard him.
Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled Paul said to them My brothers although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
They examined me and wanted to release me because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.
But when the Jews objected I was compelled to appeal to Caesarnot that I had any charge to bring against my own people.
For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.
They replied We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you and none of the brothers who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.
But we want to hear what your views are for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect.
They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.
Some were convinced by what he said but others would not believe.
They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your forefathers when he said through Isaiah the prophet
 Go to this people and say You will be ever hearing but never understanding you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
For this peoples heart has become calloused they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and I would heal them.
Therefore I want you to know that Gods salvation has been sent to the Gentiles and they will listen!
For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.
Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.
Paul a servant of Christ Jesus called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God
the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
regarding his Son who as to his human nature was a descendant of David
and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead Jesus Christ our Lord.
Through him and for his names sake we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.
And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because your faith is being reported all over the world.
God whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son is my witness how constantly I remember you
in my prayers at all times and I pray that now at last by Gods will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong
that is that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each others faith.
I do not want you to be unaware brothers that I planned many times to come to you  in order that I might have a harvest among you just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
I am obligated both to Greeks and nonGreeks both to the wise and the foolish.
That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.
I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes first for the Jew then for the Gentile.
For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed a righteousness that is by faith from first to last just as it is written The righteous will live by faith.
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness
since what may be known about God is plain to them because God has made it plain to them.
For since the creation of the world Gods invisible qualitieshis eternal power and divine naturehave been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse.
For although they knew God they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
Although they claimed to be wise they became fools
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.
Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creatorwho is forever praised. Amen.
Because of this God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.
In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.
Furthermore since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God he gave them over to a depraved mind to do what ought not to be done.
You therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on someone else for at whatever point you judge the other you are condemning yourself because you who pass judgment do the same things.
Now we know that Gods judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.
So when you a mere man pass judgment on them and yet do the same things do you think you will escape Gods judgment?
Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness tolerance and patience not realizing that Gods kindness leads you toward repentance?
But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of Gods wrath when his righteous judgment will be revealed.
God will give to each person according to what he has done.
To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality he will give eternal life.
But for those who are selfseeking and who reject the truth and follow evil there will be wrath and anger.
There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil first for the Jew then for the Gentile
but glory honor and peace for everyone who does good first for the Jew then for the Gentile.
For God does not show favoritism.
All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in Gods sight but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
(Indeed when Gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required by the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law
since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts now accusing now even defending them.)
This will take place on the day when God will judge mens secrets through Jesus Christ as my gospel declares.
Now you if you call yourself a Jew if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God
if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law
if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind a light for those who are in the dark
an instructor of the foolish a teacher of infants because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth
you then who teach others do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing do you steal?
You who say that people should not commit adultery do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols do you rob temples?
You who brag about the law do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
As it is written Gods name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.
Circumcision has value if you observe the law but if you break the law you have become as though you had not been circumcised.
If those who are not circumcised keep the laws requirements will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?
The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who even though you have the written code and circumcision are a lawbreaker.
A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.
No a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly and circumcision is circumcision of the heart by the Spirit not by the written code. Such a mans praise is not from men but from God.
What advantage then is there in being a Jew or what value is there in circumcision?
Much in every way! First of all they have been entrusted with the very words of God.
What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify Gods faithfulness?
Not at all! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.
But if our unrighteousness brings out Gods righteousness more clearly what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us?
Certainly not! If that were so how could God judge the world?
Someone might argue If my falsehood enhances Gods truthfulness and so increases his glory why am I still condemned as a sinner?
Why not sayas we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we sayLet us do evil that good may result? Their condemnation is deserved.
What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin.
As it is written There is no one righteous not even one
there is no one who understands no one who seeks God.
All have turned away they have together become worthless there is no one who does good not even one.
Their throats are open graves their tongues practice deceit. The poison of vipers is on their lips.
Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
Their feet are swift to shed blood
ruin and misery mark their ways
and the way of peace they do not know.
There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Now we know that whatever the law says it says to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law rather through the law we become conscious of sin.
But now a righteousness from God apart from law has been made known to which the Law and the Prophets testify.
This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
What then shall we say that Abraham our forefather discovered in this matter?
If in fact Abraham was justified by works he had something to boast aboutbut not before God.
What does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.
Now when a man works his wages are not credited to him as a gift but as an obligation.
However to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked his faith is credited as righteousness.
David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works
Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.
Is this blessedness only for the circumcised or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abrahams faith was credited to him as righteousness.
Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised or before? It was not after but before!
And he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised in order that righteousness might be credited to them.
And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world but through the righteousness that comes by faith.
For if those who live by law are heirs faith has no value and the promise is worthless
because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.
Therefore the promise comes by faith so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abrahams offspringnot only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.
As it is written I have made you a father of many nations. He is our father in the sight of God in whom he believedthe God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.
Against all hope Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations just as it had been said to him So shall your offspring be.
Without weakening in his faith he faced the fact that his body was as good as deadsince he was about a hundred years oldand that Sarahs womb was also dead.
Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God
Therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
Not only so but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance
perseverance character and character hope.
And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit whom he has given us.
You see at just the right time when we were still powerless Christ died for the ungodly.
Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this While we were still sinners Christ died for us.
Since we have now been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from Gods wrath through him!
For if when we were Gods enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life!
Not only is this so but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received reconciliation.
Therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned
for before the law was given sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.
Nevertheless death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses even over those who did not sin by breaking a command as did Adam who was a pattern of the one to come.
But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man how much more did Gods grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ overflow to the many!
Again the gift of God is not like the result of the one mans sin The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.
For if by the trespass of the one man death reigned through that one man how much more will those who receive Gods abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.
Consequently just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.
For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased grace increased all the more
so that just as sin reigned in death so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What shall we say then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
By no means! We died to sin how can we live in it any longer?
Or dont you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father we too may live a new life.
If we have been united with him like this in his death we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.
For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin
because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.
Now if we died with Christ we believe that we will also live with him.
For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead he cannot die again death no longer has mastery over him.
The death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to God.
In the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.
Do not offer the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness.
For sin shall not be your master because you are not under law but under grace.
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!
Dont you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves you are slaves to the one whom you obeywhether you are slaves to sin which leads to death or to obedience which leads to righteousness?
But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.
You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to everincreasing wickedness so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.
When you were slaves to sin you were free from the control of righteousness.
What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!
But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God the benefit you reap leads to holiness and the result is eternal life.
For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Do you not know brothersfor I am speaking to men who know the lawthat the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?
For example by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage.
So then if she marries another man while her husband is still alive she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies she is released from that law and is not an adulteress even though she marries another man.
So my brothers you also died to the law through the body of Christ that you might belong to another to him who was raised from the dead in order that we might bear fruit to God.
For when we were controlled by the sinful nature the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies so that we bore fruit for death.
But now by dying to what once bound us we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.
What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said Do not covet.
But sin seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law sin is dead.
Once I was alive apart from law but when the commandment came sin sprang to life and I died.
I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
For sin seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment deceived me and through the commandment put me to death.
So then the law is holy and the commandment is holy righteous and good.
Did that which is good then become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin it produced death in me through what was good so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
We know that the law is spiritual but I am unspiritual sold as a slave to sin.
I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do but what I hate I do.
And if I do what I do not want to do I agree that the law is good.
As it is it is no longer I myself who do it but it is sin living in me.
I know that nothing good lives in me that is in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good but I cannot carry it out.
For what I do is not the good I want to do no the evil I do not want to dothis I keep on doing.
Now if I do what I do not want to do it is no longer I who do it but it is sin living in me that does it.
So I find this law at work When I want to do good evil is right there with me.
For in my inner being I delight in Gods law
but I see another law at work in the members of my body waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.
What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
Thanks be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord! So then I myself in my mind am a slave to Gods law but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.
Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.
For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man
in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.
Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.
The mind of sinful man is death but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace
the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to Gods law nor can it do so.
Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God.
You however are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to Christ.
But if Christ is in you your body is dead because of sin yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.
And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who lives in you.
Therefore brothers we have an obligationbut it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it.
For if you live according to the sinful nature you will die but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live
because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry Abba Father.
The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are Gods children.
Now if we are children then we are heirsheirs of God and coheirs with Christ if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.
For the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope
that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.
We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
Not only so but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the Spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies.
For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has?
But if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently.
In the same way the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.
And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with Gods will.
And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose.
For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
And those he predestined he also called those he called he also justified those he justified he also glorified.
What then shall we say in response to this? If God is for us who can be against us?
He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us allhow will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?
I speak the truth in ChristI am not lying my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit
I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers those of my own race
the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons theirs the divine glory the covenants the receiving of the law the temple worship and the promises.
Theirs are the patriarchs and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ who is God over all forever praised! Amen.
It is not as though Gods word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.
Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abrahams children. On the contrary It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
In other words it is not the natural children who are Gods children but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abrahams offspring.
For this was how the promise was stated At the appointed time I will return and Sarah will have a son.
Not only that but Rebekahs children had one and the same father our father Isaac.
Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or badin order that Gods purpose in election might stand
not by works but by him who callsshe was told The older will serve the younger.
Just as it is written Jacob I loved but Esau I hated.
What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!
For he says to Moses I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.
It does not therefore depend on mans desire or effort but on Gods mercy.
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh I raised you up for this very purpose that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
One of you will say to me Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?
But who are you O man to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to him who formed it Why did you make me like this? 
Brothers my hearts desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God but their zeal is not based on knowledge.
Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own they did not submit to Gods righteousness.
Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law The man who does these things will live by them.
But the righteousness that is by faith says Do not say in your heart Who will ascend into heaven? 
or Who will descend into the deep?  .
But what does it say? The word is near you it is in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith we are proclaiming
That if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved.
For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.
As the Scripture says Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.
For there is no difference between Jew and Gentilethe same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him
for Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
How then can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!
But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says Lord who has believed our message?
Consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of Christ.
But I ask Did they not hear? Of course they did Their voice has gone out into all the earth their words to the ends of the world.
Again I ask Did Israel not understand? First Moses says I will make you envious by those who are not a nation I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.
And Isaiah boldly says I was found by those who did not seek me I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.
But concerning Israel he says All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.
I ask then Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin.
God did not reject his people whom he foreknew. Dont you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijahhow he appealed to God against Israel
Lord they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars I am the only one left and they are trying to kill me?
And what was Gods answer to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
So too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
And if by grace then it is no longer by works if it were grace would no longer be grace.
What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain but the elect did. The others were hardened
as it is written God gave them a spirit of stupor eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear to this very day.
And David says May their table become a snare and a trap a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see and their backs be bent forever.
Again I ask Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather because of their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.
But if their transgression means riches for the world and their loss means riches for the Gentiles how much greater riches will their fullness bring!
I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles I make much of my ministry
in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.
For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy then the whole batch is holy if the root is holy so are the branches.
If some of the branches have been broken off and you though a wild olive shoot have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root
do not boast over those branches. If you do consider this You do not support the root but the root supports you.
You will say then Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.
Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant but be afraid.
Therefore I urge you brothers in view of Gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to Godthis is your spiritual act of worship.
Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what Gods will ishis good pleasing and perfect will.
For by the grace given me I say to every one of you Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought but rather think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.
Just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function
so in Christ we who are many form one body and each member belongs to all the others.
We have different gifts according to the grace given us. If a mans gift is prophesying let him use it in proportion to his faith.
If it is serving let him serve if it is teaching let him teach
if it is encouraging let him encourage if it is contributing to the needs of others let him give generously if it is leadership let him govern diligently if it is showing mercy let him do it cheerfully.
Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil cling to what is good.
Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves.
Never be lacking in zeal but keep your spiritual fervor serving the Lord.
Be joyful in hope patient in affliction faithful in prayer.
Share with Gods people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.
Consequently he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
For rulers hold no terror for those who do right but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you.
For he is Gods servant to do you good. But if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is Gods servant an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
Therefore it is necessary to submit to the authorities not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.
This is also why you pay taxes for the authorities are Gods servants who give their full time to governing.
Give everyone what you owe him If you owe taxes pay taxes if revenue then revenue if respect then respect if honor then honor.
Let no debt remain outstanding except the continuing debt to love one another for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.
The commandments Do not commit adultery Do not murder Do not steal Do not covet and whatever other commandment there may be are summed up in this one rule Love your neighbor as yourself.
Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
And do this understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
The night is nearly over the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
Let us behave decently as in the daytime not in orgies and drunkenness not in sexual immorality and debauchery not in dissension and jealousy.
Rather clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
Accept him whose faith is weak without passing judgment on disputable matters.
One mans faith allows him to eat everything but another man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables.
The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does for God has accepted him.
Who are you to judge someone elses servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand for the Lord is able to make him stand.
One man considers one day more sacred than another another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.
He who regards one day as special does so to the Lord. He who eats meat eats to the Lord for he gives thanks to God and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.
For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone.
If we live we live to the Lord and if we die we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die we belong to the Lord.
For this very reason Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
You then why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before Gods judgment seat.
It is written  As surely as I live says the Lord every knee will bow before me every tongue will confess to God. 
So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.
Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brothers way.
As one who is in the Lord Jesus I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean then for him it is unclean.
If your brother is distressed because of what you eat you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.
Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil.
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Spirit
because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.
Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.
So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats because his eating is not from faith and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.
Each of us should please his neighbor for his good to build him up.
For even Christ did not please himself but as it is written The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.
For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus
so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Accept one another then just as Christ accepted you in order to bring praise to God.
For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of Gods truth to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs
so that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy as it is written Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles I will sing hymns to your name.
Again it says Rejoice O Gentiles with his people.
And again Praise the Lord all you Gentiles and sing praises to him all you peoples.
And again Isaiah says The Root of Jesse will spring up one who will arise to rule over the nations the Gentiles will hope in him.
May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
I myself am convinced my brothers that you yourselves are full of goodness complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another.
I have written you quite boldly on some points as if to remind you of them again because of the grace God gave me
to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.
I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done
by the power of signs and miracles through the power of the Spirit. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known so that I would not be building on someone elses foundation.
Rather as it is written Those who were not told about him will see and those who have not heard will understand.
This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
Now however I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there.
For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
I commend to you our sister Phoebe a servant of the church in Cenchrea.
I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you for she has been a great help to many people including me.
Greet Priscilla and Aquila my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.
They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.
Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.
Greet Mary who worked very hard for you.
Greet Andronicus and Junias my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles and they were in Christ before I was.
Greet Ampliatus whom I love in the Lord.
Greet Urbanus our fellow worker in Christ and my dear friend Stachys.
Greet Apelles tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
Greet Herodion my relative. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
Greet Rufus chosen in the Lord and his mother who has been a mother to me too.
Greet Asyncritus Phlegon Hermes Patrobas Hermas and the brothers with them.
Greet Philologus Julia Nereus and his sister and Olympas and all the saints with them.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.
I urge you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.
For such people are not serving our Lord Christ but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
Everyone has heard about your obedience so I am full of joy over you but I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil.
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
Timothy my fellow worker sends his greetings to you as do Lucius Jason and Sosipater my relatives.
I Tertius who wrote down this letter greet you in the Lord.
Gaius whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy sends you his greetings. Erastus who is the citys director of public works and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.
Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past
but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God so that all nations might believe and obey him
to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
Paul called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and our brother Sosthenes
To the church of God in Corinth to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christtheir Lord and ours
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.
For in him you have been enriched in every wayin all your speaking and in all your knowledge
because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.
Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.
He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord is faithful.
I appeal to you brothers in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.
My brothers some from Chloes household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.
What I mean is this One of you says I follow Paul another I follow Apollos another I follow Cephas  still another I follow Christ.
Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?
I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius
so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.
When I came to you brothers I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
I came to you in weakness and fear and with much trembling.
My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the Spirits power
so that your faith might not rest on mens wisdom but on Gods power.
We do however speak a message of wisdom among the mature but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are coming to nothing.
No we speak of Gods secret wisdom a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.
None of the rulers of this age understood it for if they had they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
However as it is written No eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him 
but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things even the deep things of God.
For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the mans spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God that we may understand what God has freely given us.
This is what we speak not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.
The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
The spiritual man makes judgments about all things but he himself is not subject to any mans judgment
For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
Brothers I could not address you as spiritual but as worldlymere infants in Christ.
I gave you milk not solid food for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed you are still not ready.
You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?
For when one says I follow Paul and another I follow Apollos are you not mere men?
What after all is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants through whom you came to believeas the Lord has assigned to each his task.
I planted the seed Apollos watered it but God made it grow.
So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything but only God who makes things grow.
The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.
For we are Gods fellow workers you are Gods field Gods building.
By the grace God has given me I laid a foundation as an expert builder and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.
For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid which is Jesus Christ.
If any man builds on this foundation using gold silver costly stones wood hay or straw
his work will be shown for what it is because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire and the fire will test the quality of each mans work.
If what he has built survives he will receive his reward.
If it is burned up he will suffer loss he himself will be saved but only as one escaping through the flames.
Dont you know that you yourselves are Gods temple and that Gods Spirit lives in you?
If anyone destroys Gods temple God will destroy him for Gods temple is sacred and you are that temple.
Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age he should become a fool so that he may become wise.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in Gods sight. As it is written He catches the wise in their craftiness 
and again The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.
So then men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.
Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.
I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court indeed I do not even judge myself.
My conscience is clear but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of mens hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.
Now brothers I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying Do not go beyond what is written. Then you will not take pride in one man over against another.
For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it why do you boast as though you did not?
Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kingsand that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you!
For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe to angels as well as to men.
We are fools for Christ but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak but you are strong! You are honored we are dishonored!
To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty we are in rags we are brutally treated we are homeless.
We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed we bless when we are persecuted we endure it
It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans A man has his fathers wife.
And you are proud! Shouldnt you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?
Even though I am not physically present I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this just as if I were present.
When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus is present
hand this man over to Satan so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.
Your boasting is not good. Dont you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?
Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeastas you really are. For Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.
Therefore let us keep the Festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and wickedness but with bread without yeast the bread of sincerity and truth.
I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people
not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.
But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy an idolater or a slanderer a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.
What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?
God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked man from among you.
If any of you has a dispute with another dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world are you not competent to judge trivial cases?
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!
Therefore if you have disputes about such matters appoint as judges even men of little account in the church!
I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?
But instead one brother goes to law against anotherand this in front of unbelievers!
The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
Instead you yourselves cheat and do wrong and you do this to your brothers.
Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders
nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
And that is what some of you were. But you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
Everything is permissible for mebut not everything is beneficial. Everything is permissible for mebut I will not be mastered by anything.
Food for the stomach and the stomach for foodbut God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord and the Lord for the body.
By his power God raised the Lord from the dead and he will raise us also.
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!
Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said The two will become one flesh.
But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.
Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.
Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have received from God? You are not your own
you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.
Now for the matters you wrote about It is good for a man not to marry.
But since there is so much immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife and likewise the wife to her husband.
The wifes body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way the husbands body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife.
Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol.
I say this as a concession not as a command.
I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God one has this gift another has that.
Now to the unmarried and the widows I say It is good for them to stay unmarried as I am.
But if they cannot control themselves they should marry for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
To the married I give this command  A wife must not separate from her husband.
But if she does she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.
To the rest I say this  If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him he must not divorce her.
Now about food sacrificed to idols We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up but love builds up.
The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know.
But the man who loves God is known by God.
So then about eating food sacrificed to idols We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one.
For even if there are socalled gods whether in heaven or on earth 
yet for us there is but one God the Father from whom all things came and for whom we live and there is but one Lord Jesus Christ through whom all things came and through whom we live.
But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol and since their conscience is weak it is defiled.
But food does not bring us near to God we are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do.
Be careful however that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak.
For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idols temple wont he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols?
So this weak brother for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge.
When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience you sin against Christ.
Therefore if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin I will never eat meat again so that I will not cause him to fall.
Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?
Even though I may not be an apostle to others surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me.
Dont we have the right to food and drink?
Dont we have the right to take a believing wife along with us as do the other apostles and the Lords brothers and Cephas ?
Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work for a living?
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk?
Do I say this merely from a human point of view? Doesnt the Law say the same thing?
For it is written in the Law of Moses Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. Is it about oxen that God is concerned?
Surely he says this for us doesnt he? Yes this was written for us because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes they ought to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest.
If we have sown spiritual seed among you is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?
If others have this right of support from you shouldnt we have it all the more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.
Dont you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?
In the same way the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.
But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of this boast.
Yet when I preach the gospel I cannot boast for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
If I preach voluntarily I have a reward if not voluntarily I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.
What then is my reward? Just this that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge and so not make use of my rights in preaching it.
Though I am free and belong to no man I make myself a slave to everyone to win as many as possible.
To the Jews I became like a Jew to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law  so as to win those under the law.
To those not having the law I became like one not having the law  so as to win those not having the law.
To the weak I became weak to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.
I do all this for the sake of the gospel that I may share in its blessings.
Do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.
Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly I do not fight like a man beating the air.
No I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact brothers that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea.
They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
They all ate the same spiritual food
and drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them and that rock was Christ.
Nevertheless God was not pleased with most of them their bodies were scattered over the desert.
Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.
Do not be idolaters as some of them were as it is written The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry.
We should not commit sexual immorality as some of them didand in one day twentythree thousand of them died.
We should not test the Lord as some of them didand were killed by snakes.
And do not grumble as some of them didand were killed by the destroying angel.
These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.
So if you think you are standing firm be careful that you dont fall!
No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.
Therefore my dear friends flee from idolatry.
I speak to sensible people judge for yourselves what I say.
Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
Because there is one loaf we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one loaf.
Consider the people of Israel Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything or that an idol is anything?
No but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons not to God and I do not want you to be participants with demons.
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too you cannot have a part in both the Lords table and the table of demons.
Are we trying to arouse the Lords jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
Everything is permissiblebut not everything is beneficial. Everything is permissiblebut not everything is constructive.
Nobody should seek his own good but the good of others.
Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience
for The earth is the Lords and everything in it.
If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.
But if anyone says to you This has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience sake 
the other mans conscience I mean not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by anothers conscience?
If I take part in the meal with thankfulness why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?
So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do it all for the glory of God.
Do not cause anyone to stumble whether Jews Greeks or the church of God
even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many so that they may be saved.
Follow my example as I follow the example of Christ.
I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings just as I passed them on to you.
Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is man and the head of Christ is God.
Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her headit is just as though her head were shaved.
If a woman does not cover her head she should have her hair cut off and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off she should cover her head.
A man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of man.
For man did not come from woman but woman from man
neither was man created for woman but woman for man.
For this reason and because of the angels the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.
In the Lord however woman is not independent of man nor is man independent of woman.
For as woman came from man so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
Judge for yourselves Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him
but that if a woman has long hair it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.
If anyone wants to be contentious about this we have no other practicenor do the churches of God.
In the following directives I have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good.
In the first place I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you and to some extent I believe it.
No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have Gods approval.
When you come together it is not the Lords Supper you eat
for as you eat each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry another gets drunk.
Dont you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!
For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you The Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed took bread
and when he had given thanks he broke it and said This is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me.
In the same way after supper he took the cup saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the Lords death until he comes.
Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.
For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.
That is why many among you are weak and sick and a number of you have fallen asleep.
Now about spiritual gifts brothers I do not want you to be ignorant.
You know that when you were pagans somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.
Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says Jesus be cursed and no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.
There are different kinds of gifts but the same Spirit.
There are different kinds of service but the same Lord.
There are different kinds of working but the same God works all of them in all men.
Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit
to another faith by the same Spirit to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit
to another miraculous powers to another prophecy to another distinguishing between spirits to another speaking in different kinds of tongues and to still another the interpretation of tongues.
All these are the work of one and the same Spirit and he gives them to each one just as he determines.
The body is a unit though it is made up of many parts and though all its parts are many they form one body. So it is with Christ.
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have a faith that can move mountains but have not love I am nothing.
If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames but have not love I gain nothing.
Love is patient love is kind. It does not envy it does not boast it is not proud.
It is not rude it is not selfseeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs.
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
It always protects always trusts always hopes always perseveres.
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies they will cease where there are tongues they will be stilled where there is knowledge it will pass away.
For we know in part and we prophesy in part
but when perfection comes the imperfect disappears.
When I was a child I talked like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a child. When I became a man I put childish ways behind me.
Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part then I shall know fully even as I am fully known.
And now these three remain faith hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts especially the gift of prophecy.
For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed no one understands him he utters mysteries with his spirit.
But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening encouragement and comfort.
He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself but he who prophesies edifies the church.
I would like every one of you to speak in tongues but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues unless he interprets so that the church may be edified.
Now brothers if I come to you and speak in tongues what good will I be to you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?
Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds such as the flute or harp how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?
Again if the trumpet does not sound a clear call who will get ready for battle?
So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world yet none of them is without meaning.
If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying I am a foreigner to the speaker and he is a foreigner to me.
So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts try to excel in gifts that build up the church.
For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.
For if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.
So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit but I will also pray with my mind I will sing with my spirit but I will also sing with my mind.
If you are praising God with your spirit how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say Amen to your thanksgiving since he does not know what you are saying?
You may be giving thanks well enough but the other man is not edified.
I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
Brothers stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants but in your thinking be adults.
In the Law it is written Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people but even then they will not listen to me says the Lord.
Tongues then are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers prophecy however is for believers not for unbelievers.
So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in will they not say that you are out of your mind?
But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all
and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God exclaiming God is really among you!
What then shall we say brothers? When you come together everyone has a hymn or a word of instruction a revelation a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.
If anyone speaks in a tongue twoor at the most threeshould speak one at a time and someone must interpret.
If there is no interpreter the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.
Two or three prophets should speak and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down the first speaker should stop.
For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.
For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints
women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak but must be in submission as the Law says.
If they want to inquire about something they should ask their own husbands at home for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?
If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lords command.
If he ignores this he himself will be ignored.
Therefore my brothers be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
Now brothers I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you which you received and on which you have taken your stand.
By this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise you have believed in vain.
For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance  that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures
that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures
and that he appeared to Peter and then to the Twelve.
After that he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep.
Then he appeared to James then to all the apostles
and last of all he appeared to me also as to one abnormally born.
For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God.
But by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace to me was not without effect. No I worked harder than all of themyet not I but the grace of God that was with me.
Whether then it was I or they this is what we preach and this is what you believed.
But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
If there is no resurrection of the dead then not even Christ has been raised.
And if Christ has not been raised our preaching is useless and so is your faith.
More than that we are then found to be false witnesses about God for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.
For if the dead are not raised then Christ has not been raised either.
And if Christ has not been raised your faith is futile you are still in your sins.
Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
If only for this life we have hope in Christ we are to be pitied more than all men.
But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
For since death came through a man the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
For as in Adam all die so in Christ all will be made alive.
But each in his own turn Christ the firstfruits then when he comes those who belong to him.
Now about the collection for Gods people Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.
On the first day of every week each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income saving it up so that when I come no collections will have to be made.
Then when I arrive I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.
If it seems advisable for me to go also they will accompany me.
After I go through Macedonia I will come to youfor I will be going through Macedonia.
Perhaps I will stay with you awhile or even spend the winter so that you can help me on my journey wherever I go.
I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits.
But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost
because a great door for effective work has opened to me and there are many who oppose me.
If Timothy comes see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you for he is carrying on the work of the Lord just as I am.
No one then should refuse to accept him. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.
Now about our brother Apollos I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now but he will go when he has the opportunity.
Be on your guard stand firm in the faith be men of courage be strong.
Do everything in love.
You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you brothers
to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it.
I was glad when Stephanas Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived because they have supplied what was lacking from you.
For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.
The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord and so does the church that meets at their house.
All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
I Paul write this greeting in my own hand.
If anyone does not love the Lorda curse be on him. Come O Lord !
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and Timothy our brother To the church of God in Corinth together with all the saints throughout Achaia
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort
who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.
For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
If we are distressed it is for your comfort and salvation if we are comforted it is for your comfort which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.
And our hope for you is firm because we know that just as you share in our sufferings so also you share in our comfort.
We do not want you to be uninformed brothers about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure far beyond our ability to endure so that we despaired even of life.
Indeed in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.
He has delivered us from such a deadly peril and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us
as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
Now this is our boast Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world and especially in our relations with you in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to Gods grace.
For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that
as you have understood us in part you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Because I was confident of this I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.
I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.
So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.
For if I grieve you who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?
I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you that you would all share my joy.
For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
If anyone has caused grief he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extentnot to put it too severely.
The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.
Now instead you ought to forgive and comfort him so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
I urge you therefore to reaffirm your love for him.
The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
If you forgive anyone I also forgive him. And what I have forgivenif there was anything to forgiveI have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake
in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me
I still had no peace of mind because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodby to them and went on to Macedonia.
But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.
For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
To the one we are the smell of death to the other the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?
Unlike so many we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary in Christ we speak before God with sincerity like men sent from God.
Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need like some people letters of recommendation to you or from you?
You yourselves are our letter written on our hearts known and read by everybody.
You show that you are a letter from Christ the result of our ministry written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.
Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves but our competence comes from God.
He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenantnot of the letter but of the Spirit for the letter kills but the Spirit gives life.
Now if the ministry that brought death which was engraved in letters on stone came with glory so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory fading though it was
will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
If the ministry that condemns men is glorious how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!
For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
And if what was fading away came with glory how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!
Therefore since we have such a hope we are very bold.
We are not like Moses who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.
But their minds were made dull for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed because only in Christ is it taken away.
Even to this day when Moses is read a veil covers their hearts.
But whenever anyone turns to the Lord the veil is taken away.
Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom.
And we who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lords glory are being transformed into his likeness with everincreasing glory which comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
Therefore since through Gods mercy we have this ministry we do not lose heart.
Rather we have renounced secret and shameful ways we do not use deception nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of God.
And even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing.
The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God.
For we do not preach ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your servants for Jesus sake.
For God who said Let light shine out of darkness made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this allsurpassing power is from God and not from us.
We are hard pressed on every side but not crushed perplexed but not in despair
persecuted but not abandoned struck down but not destroyed.
We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus sake so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.
So then death is at work in us but life is at work in you.
It is written I believed therefore I have spoken. With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak
because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.
All this is for your benefit so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
So we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal.
Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from God an eternal house in heaven not built by human hands.
Meanwhile we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling
because when we are clothed we will not be found naked.
For while we are in this tent we groan and are burdened because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come.
Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.
We live by faith not by sight.
We are confident I say and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
So we make it our goal to please him whether we are at home in the body or away from it.
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body whether good or bad.
Since then we know what it is to fear the Lord we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.
We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.
If we are out of our mind it is for the sake of God if we are in our right mind it is for you.
For Christs love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died.
And he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way we do so no longer.
Therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come!
As Gods fellow workers we urge you not to receive Gods grace in vain.
For he says In the time of my favor I heard you and in the day of salvation I helped you. I tell you now is the time of Gods favor now is the day of salvation.
We put no stumbling block in anyones path so that our ministry will not be discredited.
Rather as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way in great endurance in troubles hardships and distresses
in beatings imprisonments and riots in hard work sleepless nights and hunger
in purity understanding patience and kindness in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love
in truthful speech and in the power of God with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left
through glory and dishonor bad report and good report genuine yet regarded as impostors
known yet regarded as unknown dying and yet we live on beaten and yet not killed
sorrowful yet always rejoicing poor yet making many rich having nothing and yet possessing everything.
We have spoken freely to you Corinthians and opened wide our hearts to you.
We are not withholding our affection from you but you are withholding yours from us.
As a fair exchangeI speak as to my childrenopen wide your hearts also.
Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
Since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have exploited no one.
I do not say this to condemn you I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.
I have great confidence in you I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.
For when we came into Macedonia this body of ours had no rest but we were harassed at every turnconflicts on the outside fears within.
But God who comforts the downcast comforted us by the coming of Titus
and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me your deep sorrow your ardent concern for me so that my joy was greater than ever.
Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter I do not regret it. Though I did regret itI see that my letter hurt you but only for a little while
yet now I am happy not because you were made sorry but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.
Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret but worldly sorrow brings death.
See what this godly sorrow has produced in you what earnestness what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what concern what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
So even though I wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.
By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
I had boasted to him about you and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.
And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient receiving him with fear and trembling.
I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
And now brothers we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.
Out of the most severe trial their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.
For I testify that they gave as much as they were able and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own
they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.
And they did not do as we expected but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with Gods will.
So we urged Titus since he had earlier made a beginning to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.
But just as you excel in everythingin faith in speech in knowledge in complete earnestness and in your love for us see that you also excel in this grace of giving.
I am not commanding you but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that you through his poverty might become rich.
And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.
Now finish the work so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it according to your means.
For if the willingness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one has not according to what he does not have.
Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed but that there might be equality.
At the present time your plenty will supply what they need so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality
There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints.
For I know your eagerness to help and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.
But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow but that you may be ready as I said you would be.
For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared wenot to say anything about youwould be ashamed of having been so confident.
So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift not as one grudgingly given.
Remember this Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver.
And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work.
As it is written He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor his righteousness endures forever.
Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of Gods people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.
And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you because of the surpassing grace God has given you.
Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
By the meekness and gentleness of Christ I appeal to youI Paul who am timid when face to face with you but bold when away!
I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.
For though we live in the world we do not wage war as the world does.
The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete.
You are looking only on the surface of things. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ he should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as he.
For even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than pulling you down I will not be ashamed of it.
I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.
For some say His letters are weighty and forceful but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.
Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent we will be in our actions when we are present.
We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves they are not wise.
We however will not boast beyond proper limits but will confine our boasting to the field God has assigned to us a field that reaches even to you.
We are not going too far in our boasting as would be the case if we had not come to you for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.
Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that as your faith continues to grow our area of activity among you will greatly expand
so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in another mans territory.
But Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.
For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved but the one whom the Lord commends.
I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness but you are already doing that.
I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband to Christ so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.
But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpents cunning your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you put up with it easily enough.
But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those superapostles.
I may not be a trained speaker but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.
Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?
I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.
And when I was with you and needed something I was not a burden to anyone for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way and will continue to do so.
As surely as the truth of Christ is in me nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.
Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.
For such men are false apostles deceitful workmen masquerading as apostles of Christ.
And no wonder for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
It is not surprising then if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.
I repeat Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do then receive me just as you would a fool so that I may do a little boasting.
In this selfconfident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would but as a fool.
Since many are boasting in the way the world does I too will boast.
You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!
In fact you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.
I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not knowGod knows.
And I know that this manwhether in the body or apart from the body I do not know but God knows
was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things things that man is not permitted to tell.
I will boast about a man like that but I will not boast about myself except about my weaknesses.
Even if I should choose to boast I would not be a fool because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.
To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations there was given me a thorn in my flesh a messenger of Satan to torment me.
Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
But he said to me My grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christs power may rest on me.
That is why for Christs sake I delight in weaknesses in insults in hardships in persecutions in difficulties. For when I am weak then I am strong.
I have made a fool of myself but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you for I am not in the least inferior to the superapostles even though I am nothing.
The things that mark an apostlesigns wonders and miracleswere done among you with great perseverance.
This will be my third visit to you. Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others
since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful among you.
For to be sure he was crucified in weakness yet he lives by Gods power. Likewise we are weak in him yet by Gods power we will live with him to serve you.
Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in youunless of course you fail the test?
And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.
Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.
For we cannot do anything against the truth but only for the truth.
We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong and our prayer is for your perfection.
This is why I write these things when I am absent that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authoritythe authority the Lord gave me for building you up not for tearing you down.
Finally brothers goodby. Aim for perfection listen to my appeal be of one mind live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints send their greetings.
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
Paul an apostlesent not from men nor by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead
and all the brothers with me To the churches in Galatia
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel
which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let him be eternally condemned!
As we have already said so now I say again If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted let him be eternally condemned!
Am I now trying to win the approval of men or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men I would not be a servant of Christ.
I want you to know brothers that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.
I did not receive it from any man nor was I taught it rather I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.
For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.
I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
But when God who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased
to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles I did not consult any man
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.
I saw none of the other apostlesonly James the Lords brother.
I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.
Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.
I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.
Yet not even Titus who was with me was compelled to be circumcised even though he was a Greek.
This matter arose because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.
We did not give in to them for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
As for those who seemed to be importantwhatever they were makes no difference to me God does not judge by external appearancethose men added nothing to my message.
On the contrary they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles just as Peter had been to the Jews.
For God who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.
James Peter and John those reputed to be pillars gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews.
All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor the very thing I was eager to do.
When Peter came to Antioch I opposed him to his face because he was clearly in the wrong.
Before certain men came from James he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.
The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.
When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel I said to Peter in front of them all You are a Jew yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it then that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?
We who are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners
know that a man is not justified by observing the law but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we too have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law because by observing the law no one will be justified.
If while we seek to be justified in Christ it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!
If I rebuild what I destroyed I prove that I am a lawbreaker.
For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.
I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
I do not set aside the grace of God for if righteousness could be gained through the law Christ died for nothing!
You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.
I would like to learn just one thing from you Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law or by believing what you heard?
Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?
Have you suffered so much for nothingif it really was for nothing?
Does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you because you observe the law or because you believe what you heard?
Consider Abraham He believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.
Understand then that those who believe are children of Abraham.
The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham All nations will be blessed through you.
So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham the man of faith.
All who rely on observing the law are under a curse for it is written Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.
Clearly no one is justified before God by the law because The righteous will live by faith.
The law is not based on faith on the contrary The man who does these things will live by them.
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us for it is written Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.
He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
Brothers let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established so it is in this case.
The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say and to seeds meaning many people but and to your seed meaning one person who is Christ.
What I mean is this The law introduced 430 years later does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.
For if the inheritance depends on the law then it no longer depends on a promise but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
What then was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator.
A mediator however does not represent just one party but God is one.
Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.
But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin so that what was promised being given through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
Before this faith came we were held prisoners by the law locked up until faith should be revealed.
So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.
Now that faith has come we are no longer under the supervision of the law.
You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus
for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek slave nor free male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
If you belong to Christ then you are Abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise.
What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child he is no different from a slave although he owns the whole estate.
He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
So also when we were children we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.
But when the time had fully come God sent his Son born of a woman born under law
to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of sons.
Because you are sons God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts the Spirit who calls out Abba Father.
So you are no longer a slave but a son and since you are a son God has made you also an heir.
Formerly when you did not know God you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.
But now that you know Godor rather are known by Godhow is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?
You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!
I fear for you that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.
I plead with you brothers become like me for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.
As you know it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.
Even though my illness was a trial to you you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that if you could have done so you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Those people are zealous to win you over but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us so that you may be zealous for them.
It is fine to be zealous provided the purpose is good and to be so always and not just when I am with you.
My dear children for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you
how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone because I am perplexed about you!
Tell me you who want to be under the law are you not aware of what the law says?
For it is written that Abraham had two sons one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.
His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.
These things may be taken figuratively for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves This is Hagar.
Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem because she is in slavery with her children.
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
Mark my words! I Paul tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised Christ will be of no value to you at all.
Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ you have fallen away from grace.
But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth?
That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.
I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty whoever he may be.
Brothers if I am still preaching circumcision why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.
As for those agitators I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!
You my brothers were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature rather serve one another in love.
The entire law is summed up in a single command Love your neighbor as yourself.
If you keep on biting and devouring each other watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.
So I say live by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other so that you do not do what you want.
Brothers if someone is caught in a sin you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself or you also may be tempted.
Carry each others burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself.
Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself without comparing himself to somebody else
for each one should carry his own load.
Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.
Do not be deceived God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
The one who sows to please his sinful nature from that nature will reap destruction the one who sows to please the Spirit from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
Let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
Therefore as we have opportunity let us do good to all people especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Not even those who are circumcised obey the law yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh.
May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything what counts is a new creation.
Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule even to the Israel of God.
Finally let no one cause me trouble for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit brothers. Amen.
Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God To the saints in Ephesus the faithful in Christ Jesus
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love
he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ in accordance with his pleasure and will
to the praise of his glorious grace which he has freely given us in the One he loves.
In him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of Gods grace
that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
And he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in Christ
to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillmentto bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head even Christ.
In him we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will
in order that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be for the praise of his glory.
And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation. Having believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised Holy Spirit
who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are Gods possessionto the praise of his glory.
For this reason ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints
I have not stopped giving thanks for you remembering you in my prayers.
I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the glorious Father may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you may know him better.
I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints
and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength
which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms
far above all rule and authority power and dominion and every title that can be given not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
As for you you were dead in your transgressions and sins
in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
All of us also lived among them at one time gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest we were by nature objects of wrath.
But because of his great love for us God who is rich in mercy
made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressionsit is by grace you have been saved.
And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus
in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
For it is by grace you have been saved through faithand this not from yourselves it is the gift of God
not by works so that no one can boast.
For we are Gods workmanship created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared in advance for us to do.
Therefore remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called uncircumcised by those who call themselves the circumcision 
remember that at that time you were separate from Christ excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise without hope and without God in the world.
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
For he himself is our peace who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier the dividing wall of hostility
by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two thus making peace
and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross by which he put to death their hostility.
He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
Consequently you are no longer foreigners and aliens but fellow citizens with Gods people and members of Gods household
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
For this reason I Paul the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles
Surely you have heard about the administration of Gods grace that was given to me for you
that is the mystery made known to me by revelation as I have already written briefly.
In reading this then you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ
which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to Gods holy apostles and prophets.
This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel members together of one body and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.
I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of Gods grace given me through the working of his power.
Although I am less than the least of all Gods people this grace was given me to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ
and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery which for ages past was kept hidden in God who created all things.
His intent was that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms
according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
I ask you therefore not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you which are your glory.
For this reason I kneel before the Father
from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you being rooted and established in love
may have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ
and to know this love that surpasses knowledgethat you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us
to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations for ever and ever! Amen.
As a prisoner for the Lord then I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
Be completely humble and gentle be patient bearing with one another in love.
Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
There is one body and one Spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called
one Lord one faith one baptism
one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
This is why it says When he ascended on high he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men.
(What does he ascended mean except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions?
He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill the whole universe.)
It was he who gave some to be apostles some to be prophets some to be evangelists and some to be pastors and teachers
to prepare Gods people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up
until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.
Instead speaking the truth in love we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head that is Christ.
From him the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work.
So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do in the futility of their thinking.
They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
Having lost all sensitivity they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity with a continual lust for more.
You however did not come to know Christ that way.
Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires
to be made new in the attitude of your minds
and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor for we are all members of one body.
In your anger do not sin Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry
and do not give the devil a foothold.
He who has been stealing must steal no longer but must work doing something useful with his own hands that he may have something to share with those in need.
Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen.
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Get rid of all bitterness rage and anger brawling and slander along with every form of malice.
Be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you.
Be imitators of God therefore as dearly loved children
and live a life of love just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity or of greed because these are improper for Gods holy people.
Nor should there be obscenity foolish talk or coarse joking which are out of place but rather thanksgiving.
For of this you can be sure No immoral impure or greedy personsuch a man is an idolaterhas any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Let no one deceive you with empty words for because of such things Gods wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
Therefore do not be partners with them.
For you were once darkness but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light

and find out what pleases the Lord.
Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness but rather expose them.
For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
But everything exposed by the light becomes visible
for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said Wake up O sleeper rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you.
Be very careful then how you livenot as unwise but as wise
making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil.
Therefore do not be foolish but understand what the Lords will is.
Do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery. Instead be filled with the Spirit.
Speak to one another with psalms hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord
always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
Wives submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church his body of which he is the Savior.
Children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
Honor your father and motherwhich is the first commandment with a promise
that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.
Fathers do not exasperate your children instead bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
Slaves obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and with sincerity of heart just as you would obey Christ.
Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you but like slaves of Christ doing the will of God from your heart.
Serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving the Lord not men
because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does whether he is slave or free.
And masters treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven and there is no favoritism with him.
Finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devils schemes.
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
Therefore put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand your ground and after you have done everything to stand.
Stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist with the breastplate of righteousness in place
and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
In addition to all this take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.
Pray also for me that whenever I open my mouth words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel
for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly as I should.
Tychicus the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord will tell you everything so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.
I am sending him to you for this very purpose that you may know how we are and that he may encourage you.
Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
Paul and Timothy servants of Christ Jesus To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi together with the overseers and deacons
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God every time I remember you.
In all my prayers for all of you I always pray with joy
because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now
being confident of this that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
It is right for me to feel this way about all of you since I have you in my heart for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel all of you share in Gods grace with me.
God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
And this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight
so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christto the glory and praise of God.
Now I want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.
As a result it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
Because of my chains most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.
It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry but others out of goodwill.
The latter do so in love knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way whether from false motives or true Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes and I will continue to rejoice
for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body whether by life or by death.
For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
If I am to go on living in the body this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!
I am torn between the two I desire to depart and be with Christ which is better by far
but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
Convinced of this I know that I will remain and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith
so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.
Whatever happens conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence I will know that you stand firm in one spirit contending as one man for the faith of the gospel
without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed but that you will be savedand that by God.
For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for him
since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ if any comfort from his love if any fellowship with the Spirit if any tenderness and compassion
then make my joy complete by being likeminded having the same love being one in spirit and purpose.
Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves.
Each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others.
Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus
Who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be grasped
but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross!
Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth
and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
Therefore my dear friends as you have always obeyednot only in my presence but now much more in my absencecontinue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling
for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.
Do everything without complaining or arguing
so that you may become blameless and pure children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation in which you shine like stars in the universe
as you hold out the word of lifein order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for nothing.
But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.
I have no one else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.
Finally my brothers rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again and it is a safeguard for you.
Watch out for those dogs those men who do evil those mutilators of the flesh.
For it is we who are the circumcision we who worship by the Spirit of God who glory in Christ Jesus and who put no confidence in the flesh
though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh I have more
circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel of the tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews in regard to the law a Pharisee
as for zeal persecuting the church as for legalistic righteousness faultless.
But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
What is more I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish that I may gain Christ
and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but that which is through faith in Christthe righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.
I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings becoming like him in his death
and so somehow to attain to the resurrection from the dead.
Not that I have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
Brothers I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead
I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently that too God will make clear to you.
Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
Join with others in following my example brothers and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.
For as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
Their destiny is destruction their god is their stomach and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things.
But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there the Lord Jesus Christ
who by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
Therefore my brothers you whom I love and long for my joy and crown that is how you should stand firm in the Lord dear friends!
I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.
Yes and I ask you loyal yokefellow help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life.
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again Rejoice!
Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.
Do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to God.
And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
Finally brothers whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirableif anything is excellent or praiseworthythink about such things.
Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in meput it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed you have been concerned but you had no opportunity to show it.
I am not saying this because I am in need for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty or in want.
I can do everything through him who gives me strength.
Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.
Moreover as you Philippians know in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel when I set out from Macedonia not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only
for even when I was in Thessalonica you sent me aid again and again when I was in need.
Not that I am looking for a gift but I am looking for what may be credited to your account.
I have received full payment and even more I am amply supplied now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering an acceptable sacrifice pleasing to God.
And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.
To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send greetings.
All the saints send you greetings especially those who belong to Caesars household.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and Timothy our brother
To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
We always thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you
because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints
the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth the gospel
that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood Gods grace in all its truth.
You learned it from Epaphras our dear fellow servant who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf
and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
For this reason since the day we heard about you we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way bearing fruit in every good work growing in the knowledge of God
being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience and joyfully
giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.
For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves
in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins.
He is the image of the invisible God the firstborn over all creation.
For by him all things were created things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities all things were created by him and for him.
He is before all things and in him all things hold together.
And he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him
and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on the cross.
Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
But now he has reconciled you by Christs physical body through death to present you holy in his sight without blemish and free from accusation
I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not met me personally.
My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding in order that they may know the mystery of God namely Christ
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by finesounding arguments.
For though I am absent from you in body I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
So then just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord continue to live in him
rooted and built up in him strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness.
See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.
For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form
and you have been given fullness in Christ who is the head over every power and authority.
In him you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ
having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead.
When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins
having canceled the written code with its regulations that was against us and that stood opposed to us he took it away nailing it to the cross.
And having disarmed the powers and authorities he made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross.
Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink or with regard to a religious festival a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.
These are a shadow of the things that were to come the reality however is found in Christ.
Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.
He has lost connection with the Head from whom the whole body supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows as God causes it to grow.
Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world why as though you still belonged to it do you submit to its rules
Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!?
These are all destined to perish with use because they are based on human commands and teachings.
Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom with their selfimposed worship their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
Since then you have been raised with Christ set your hearts on things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
Set your minds on things above not on earthly things.
For you died and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ who is your life appears then you also will appear with him in glory.
Put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature sexual immorality impurity lust evil desires and greed which is idolatry.
Because of these the wrath of God is coming.
You used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived.
But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these anger rage malice slander and filthy language from your lips.
Do not lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices
and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.
Here there is no Greek or Jew circumcised or uncircumcised barbarian Scythian slave or free but Christ is all and is in all.
Therefore as Gods chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience.
Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
And over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity.
Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom and as you sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.
And whatever you do whether in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him.
Masters provide your slaves with what is right and fair because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.
Devote yourselves to prayer being watchful and thankful.
And pray for us too that God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ for which I am in chains.
Pray that I may proclaim it clearly as I should.
Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders make the most of every opportunity.
Let your conversation be always full of grace seasoned with salt so that you may know how to answer everyone.
Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
He is coming with Onesimus our faithful and dear brother who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.
Paul Silas and Timothy To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace and peace to you.
We always thank God for all of you mentioning you in our prayers.
We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith your labor prompted by love and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
For we know brothers loved by God that he has chosen you
because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.
You became imitators of us and of the Lord in spite of severe suffering you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
The Lords message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaiayour faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it
for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God
and to wait for his Son from heaven whom he raised from the deadJesus who rescues us from the coming wrath.
You know brothers that our visit to you was not a failure.
We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi as you know but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.
For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives nor are we trying to trick you.
On the contrary we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God who tests our hearts.
You know we never used flattery nor did we put on a mask to cover up greedGod is our witness.
We were not looking for praise from men not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you
but we were gentle among you like a mother caring for her little children.
We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well because you had become so dear to us.
Surely you remember brothers our toil and hardship we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.
You are witnesses and so is God of how holy righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.
For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children
encouraging comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
So when we could stand it no longer we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.
We sent Timothy who is our brother and Gods fellow worker in spreading the gospel of Christ to strengthen and encourage you in your faith
so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them.
In fact when we were with you we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way as you well know.
For this reason when I could stand it no longer I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless.
But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us just as we also long to see you.
Therefore brothers in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.
For now we really live since you are standing firm in the Lord.
How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?
Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.
Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.
May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else just as ours does for you.
May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
Finally brothers we instructed you how to live in order to please God as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.
For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
It is Gods will that you should be sanctified that you should avoid sexual immorality
that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable
not in passionate lust like the heathen who do not know God
and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him. The Lord will punish men for all such sins as we have already told you and warned you.
For God did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life.
Therefore he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
Now about brotherly love we do not need to write to you for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.
And in fact you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you brothers to do so more and more.
Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life to mind your own business and to work with your hands just as we told you
so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.
Brothers we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep or to grieve like the rest of men who have no hope.
We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
According to the Lords own word we tell you that we who are still alive who are left till the coming of the Lord will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God and the dead in Christ will rise first.
After that we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.
Therefore encourage each other with these words.
Now brothers about times and dates we do not need to write to you
for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
While people are saying Peace and safety destruction will come on them suddenly as labor pains on a pregnant woman and they will not escape.
But you brothers are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
So then let us not be like others who are asleep but let us be alert and selfcontrolled.
For those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk get drunk at night.
But since we belong to the day let us be selfcontrolled putting on faith and love as a breastplate and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
He died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live together with him.
Therefore encourage one another and build each other up just as in fact you are doing.
Paul Silas and Timothy To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We ought always to thank God for you brothers and rightly so because your faith is growing more and more and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.
Therefore among Gods churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.
All this is evidence that Gods judgment is right and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you are suffering.
God is just He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
and give relief to you who are troubled and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.
He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power
on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you because you believed our testimony to you.
With this in mind we constantly pray for you that our God may count you worthy of his calling and that by his power he may fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith.
We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him we ask you brothers
not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy report or letter supposed to have come from us saying that the day of the Lord has already come.
Dont let anyone deceive you in any way for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed the man doomed to destruction.
He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped so that he sets himself up in Gods temple proclaiming himself to be God.
Dont you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?
And now you know what is holding him back so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
And then the lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles signs and wonders
and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie
and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
But we ought always to thank God for you brothers loved by the Lord because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
He called you to this through our gospel that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
So then brothers stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you whether by word of mouth or by letter.
May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope
encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
Finally brothers pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored just as it was with you.
And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men for not everyone has faith.
But the Lord is faithful and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.
We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.
May the Lord direct your hearts into Gods love and Christs perseverance.
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we command you brothers to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you
nor did we eat anyones food without paying for it. On the contrary we worked night and day laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
We did this not because we do not have the right to such help but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow.
For even when we were with you we gave you this rule If a man will not work he shall not eat.
We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy they are busybodies.
Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.
And as for you brothers never tire of doing what is right.
If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter take special note of him. Do not associate with him in order that he may feel ashamed.
Yet do not regard him as an enemy but warn him as a brother.
Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
I Paul write this greeting in my own hand which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope
To Timothy my true son in the faith Grace mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
As I urged you when I went into Macedonia stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer
nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than Gods workwhich is by faith.
The goal of this command is love which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk.
They want to be teachers of the law but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.
We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels the ungodly and sinful the unholy and irreligious for those who kill their fathers or mothers for murderers
for adulterers and perverts for slave traders and liars and perjurersand for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine
that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which he entrusted to me.
I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me strength that he considered me faithful appointing me to his service.
Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
I urge then first of all that requests prayers intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone
for kings and all those in authority that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
This is good and pleases God our Savior
who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
For there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus
who gave himself as a ransom for all menthe testimony given in its proper time.
And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostleI am telling the truth I am not lyingand a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.
I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer without anger or disputing.
I also want women to dress modestly with decency and propriety not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes
but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man she must be silent.
For Adam was formed first then Eve.
And Adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
But women will be saved through childbearingif they continue in faith love and holiness with propriety.
Here is a trustworthy saying If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer he desires a noble task.
Now the overseer must be above reproach the husband of but one wife temperate selfcontrolled respectable hospitable able to teach
not given to drunkenness not violent but gentle not quarrelsome not a lover of money.
He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.

He must not be a recent convert or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
He must also have a good reputation with outsiders so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devils trap.
Deacons likewise are to be men worthy of respect sincere not indulging in much wine and not pursuing dishonest gain.
They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
They must first be tested and then if there is nothing against them let them serve as deacons.
In the same way their wives are to be women worthy of respect not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.
A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well.
Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.
Although I hope to come to you soon I am writing you these instructions so that
if I am delayed you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in Gods household which is the church of the living God the pillar and foundation of the truth.
Beyond all question the mystery of godliness is great He appeared in a body was vindicated by the Spirit was seen by angels was preached among the nations was believed on in the world was taken up in glory.
The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
Such teachings come through hypocritical liars whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.
They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.
For everything God created is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving
because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.
If you point these things out to the brothers you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives tales rather train yourself to be godly.
For physical training is of some value but godliness has value for all things holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance
 that we have put our hope in the living God who is the Savior of all men and especially of those who believe.
Command and teach these things.
Dont let anyone look down on you because you are young but set an example for the believers in speech in life in love in faith and in purity.
Until I come devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture to preaching and to teaching.
Do not neglect your gift which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
Be diligent in these matters give yourself wholly to them so that everyone may see your progress.
Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them because if you do you will save both yourself and your hearers.
Do not rebuke an older man harshly but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers
older women as mothers and younger women as sisters with absolute purity.
Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
But if a widow has children or grandchildren these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents for this is pleasing to God.
The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.
But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
Give the people these instructions too so that no one may be open to blame.
If anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty has been faithful to her husband
and is well known for her good deeds such as bringing up children showing hospitality washing the feet of the saints helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.
As for younger widows do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ they want to marry.
Thus they bring judgment on themselves because they have broken their first pledge.
Besides they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers but also gossips and busybodies saying things they ought not to.
So I counsel younger widows to marry to have children to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.
The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.
For the Scripture says Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain and The worker deserves his wages.
Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.
Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly so that the others may take warning.
All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect so that Gods name and our teaching may not be slandered.
Those who have believing masters are not to show less respect for them because they are brothers. Instead they are to serve them even better because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them. These are the things you are to teach and urge on them.
If anyone teaches false doctrines and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching
he is conceited and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy strife malicious talk evil suspicions
and constant friction between men of corrupt mind who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.
But godliness with contentment is great gain.
For we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it.
But if we have food and clothing we will be content with that.
People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
But you man of God flee from all this and pursue righteousness godliness faith love endurance and gentleness.
Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
In the sight of God who gives life to everything and of Christ Jesus who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession I charge you
to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
which God will bring about in his own timeGod the blessed and only Ruler the King of kings and Lord of lords
who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.
Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth which is so uncertain but to put their hope in God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus
To Timothy my dear son Grace mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I thank God whom I serve as my forefathers did with a clear conscience as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
Recalling your tears I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.
I have been reminded of your sincere faith which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and I am persuaded now lives in you also.
For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power of love and of selfdiscipline.
So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel by the power of God
who has saved us and called us to a holy lifenot because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time
but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.
That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed because I know whom I have believed and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.
What you heard from me keep as the pattern of sound teaching with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to youguard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
On the contrary when he was in Rome he searched hard for me until he found me.
May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
You then my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.
Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairshe wants to please his commanding officer.
Similarly if anyone competes as an athlete he does not receive the victors crown unless he competes according to the rules.
The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
Reflect on what I am saying for the Lord will give you insight into all this.
Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead descended from David. This is my gospel
for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But Gods word is not chained.
Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
Here is a trustworthy saying If we died with him we will also live with him
if we endure we will also reign with him. If we disown him he will also disown us
if we are faithless he will remain faithful for he cannot disown himself.
Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words it is of no value and only ruins those who listen.
Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.
Avoid godless chatter because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.
But mark this There will be terrible times in the last days.
People will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boastful proud abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy
without love unforgiving slanderous without selfcontrol brutal not lovers of the good
treacherous rash conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.
They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weakwilled women who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires
always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses so also these men oppose the truthmen of depraved minds who as far as the faith is concerned are rejected.
But they will not get very far because as in the case of those men their folly will be clear to everyone.
You however know all about my teaching my way of life my purpose faith patience love endurance
persecutions sufferingswhat kinds of things happened to me in Antioch Iconium and Lystra the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
In fact everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted
while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving and being deceived.
But as for you continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of because you know those from whom you learned it
and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is Godbreathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness
so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who will judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom I give you this charge
Preach the Word be prepared in season and out of season correct rebuke and encouragewith great patience and careful instruction.
For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead to suit their own desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
But you keep your head in all situations endure hardship do the work of an evangelist discharge all the duties of your ministry.
For I am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure.
I have fought the good fight I have finished the race I have kept the faith.
Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous Judge will award to me on that dayand not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
Do your best to come to me quickly
for Demas because he loved this world has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia.
Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you because he is helpful to me in my ministry.
I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
When you come bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas and my scrolls especially the parchments.
Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.
You too should be on your guard against him because he strongly opposed our message.
Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of Gods elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness
a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life which God who does not lie promised before the beginning of time
and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior
To Titus my true son in our common faith Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town as I directed you.
An elder must be blameless the husband of but one wife a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.
Since an overseer is entrusted with Gods work he must be blamelessnot overbearing not quicktempered not given to drunkenness not violent not pursuing dishonest gain.
Rather he must be hospitable one who loves what is good who is selfcontrolled upright holy and disciplined.
He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
For there are many rebellious people mere talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision group.
They must be silenced because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teachand that for the sake of dishonest gain.
Even one of their own prophets has said Cretans are always liars evil brutes lazy gluttons.
This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith
and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.
You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.
Teach the older men to be temperate worthy of respect selfcontrolled and sound in faith in love and in endurance.
Likewise teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine but to teach what is good.
Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children
to be selfcontrolled and pure to be busy at home to be kind and to be subject to their husbands so that no one will malign the word of God.
Similarly encourage the young men to be selfcontrolled.
In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity seriousness
and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything to try to please them not to talk back to them
and not to steal from them but to show that they can be fully trusted so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.
It teaches us to say No to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live selfcontrolled upright and godly lives in this present age
while we wait for the blessed hopethe glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ
who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own eager to do what is good.
These then are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready to do whatever is good
to slander no one to be peaceable and considerate and to show true humility toward all men.
At one time we too were foolish disobedient deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy being hated and hating one another.
But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared
he saved us not because of righteous things we had done but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit
whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior
so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law because these are unprofitable and useless.
Warn a divisive person once and then warn him a second time. After that have nothing to do with him.
You may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful he is selfcondemned.
As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you do your best to come to me at Nicopolis because I have decided to winter there.
Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need.
Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good in order that they may provide for daily necessities and not live unproductive lives.
Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Paul a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy our brother To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker
to Apphia our sister to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers
because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.
Your love has given me great joy and encouragement because you brother have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
Therefore although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do
yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then as Paulan old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus who became my son while I was in chains.
Formerly he was useless to you but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
I am sending himwho is my very heartback to you.
I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways
but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son whom he appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the universe.
The Son is the radiance of Gods glory and the exact representation of his being sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.
So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
For to which of the angels did God ever say You are my Son today I have become your Father ? Or again I will be his Father and he will be my Son?
And again when God brings his firstborn into the world he says Let all Gods angels worship him.
In speaking of the angels he says He makes his angels winds his servants flames of fire.
But about the Son he says Your throne O God will last for ever and ever and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore God your God has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.
He also says In the beginning O Lord you laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands.
They will perish but you remain they will all wear out like a garment.
You will roll them up like a robe like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same and your years will never end.
To which of the angels did God ever say Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?
Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
We must pay more careful attention therefore to what we have heard so that we do not drift away.
For if the message spoken by angels was binding and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment
how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation which was first announced by the Lord was confirmed to us by those who heard him.
God also testified to it by signs wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come about which we are speaking.
But there is a place where someone has testified What is man that you are mindful of him the son of man that you care for him?
You made him a little lower than the angels you crowned him with glory and honor
and put everything under his feet. In putting everything under him God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.
But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
In bringing many sons to glory it was fitting that God for whom and through whom everything exists should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.
Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.
He says I will declare your name to my brothers in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises.
And again I will put my trust in him. And again he says Here am I and the children God has given me.
Since the children have flesh and blood he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of deaththat is the devil
and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
For surely it is not angels he helps but Abrahams descendants.
For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
Because he himself suffered when he was tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted.
Therefore holy brothers who share in the heavenly calling fix your thoughts on Jesus the apostle and high priest whom we confess.
He was faithful to the one who appointed him just as Moses was faithful in all Gods house.
Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.
For every house is built by someone but God is the builder of everything.
Moses was faithful as a servant in all Gods house testifying to what would be said in the future.
But Christ is faithful as a son over Gods house. And we are his house if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.
So as the Holy Spirit says Today if you hear his voice
do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion during the time of testing in the desert
where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.
That is why I was angry with that generation and I said Their hearts are always going astray and they have not known my ways.
So I declared on oath in my anger They shall never enter my rest. 
See to it brothers that none of you has a sinful unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
But encourage one another daily as long as it is called Today so that none of you may be hardened by sins deceitfulness.
We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.
As has just been said Today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.
Therefore since the promise of entering his rest still stands let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
For we also have had the gospel preached to us just as they did but the message they heard was of no value to them because those who heard did not combine it with faith.
Now we who have believed enter that rest just as God has said So I declared on oath in my anger They shall never enter my rest.  And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world.
For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words And on the seventh day God rested from all his work.
And again in the passage above he says They shall never enter my rest.
It still remains that some will enter that rest and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in because of their disobedience.
Therefore God again set a certain day calling it Today when a long time later he spoke through David as was said before Today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts.
For if Joshua had given them rest God would not have spoken later about another day.
There remains then a Sabbathrest for the people of God
for anyone who enters Gods rest also rests from his own work just as God did from his.
Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.
For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any doubleedged sword it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit joints and marrow it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
Nothing in all creation is hidden from Gods sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray since he himself is subject to weakness.
This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for the sins of the people.
No one takes this honor upon himself he must be called by God just as Aaron was.
So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him You are my Son today I have become your Father. 
And he says in another place You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
During the days of Jesus life on earth he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
Although he was a son he learned obedience from what he suffered
and once made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
We have much to say about this but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn.
In fact though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of Gods word all over again. You need milk not solid food!
Anyone who lives on milk being still an infant is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.
But solid food is for the mature who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death and of faith in God
instruction about baptisms the laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.
And God permitting we will do so.
It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened who have tasted the heavenly gift who have shared in the Holy Spirit
who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age
if they fall away to be brought back to repentance because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.
Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.
But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
Even though we speak like this dear friends we are confident of better things in your casethings that accompany salvation.
God is not unjust he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end in order to make your hope sure.
We do not want you to become lazy but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.
When God made his promise to Abraham since there was no one greater for him to swear by he swore by himself
saying I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.
And so after waiting patiently Abraham received what was promised.
Men swear by someone greater than themselves and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.
Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised he confirmed it with an oath.
God did this so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged.
We have this hope as an anchor for the soul firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain
where Jesus who went before us has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him
and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First his name means king of righteousness then also king of Salem means king of peace.
Without father or mother without genealogy without beginning of days or end of life like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.
Just think how great he was Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!
Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the peoplethat is their brotherseven though their brothers are descended from Abraham.
This man however did not trace his descent from Levi yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater.
In the one case the tenth is collected by men who die but in the other case by him who is declared to be living.
One might even say that Levi who collects the tenth paid the tenth through Abraham
because when Melchizedek met Abraham Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.
If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood  why was there still need for another priest to comeone in the order of Melchizedek not in the order of Aaron?
For when there is a change of the priesthood there must also be a change of the law.
The point of what we are saying is this We do have such a high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven
and who serves in the sanctuary the true tabernacle set up by the Lord not by man.
Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
If he were on earth he would not be a priest for there are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one and it is founded on better promises.
For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant no place would have been sought for another.
But God found fault with the people and said The time is coming declares the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt because they did not remain faithful to my covenant and I turned away from them declares the Lord.
This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people.
No longer will a man teach his neighbor or a man his brother saying Know the Lord because they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest.
For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.
By calling this covenant new he has made the first one obsolete and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.
Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.
A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand the table and the consecrated bread this was called the Holy Place.
Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place
which had the golden altar of incense and the goldcovered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna Aarons staff that had budded and the stone tablets of the covenant.
Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
When everything had been arranged like this the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.
But only the high priest entered the inner room and that only once a year and never without blood which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.
This is an illustration for the present time indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.
They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washingsexternal regulations applying until the time of the new order.
When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not manmade that is to say not a part of this creation.
He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood having obtained eternal redemption.
The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.
How much more then will the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death so that we may serve the living God!
For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritancenow that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
In the case of a will it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it
because a will is in force only when somebody has died it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.
This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people he took the blood of calves together with water scarlet wool and branches of hyssop and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.
He said This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you to keep.
In the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.
In fact the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
It was necessary then for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
For Christ did not enter a manmade sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one he entered heaven itself now to appear for us in Gods presence.
Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Just as man is destined to die once and after that to face judgment
so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people and he will appear a second time not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
The law is only a shadow of the good things that are comingnot the realities themselves. For this reason it can never by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year make perfect those who draw near to worship.
If it could would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.
But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins
because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Therefore when Christ came into the world he said Sacrifice and offering you did not desire but a body you prepared for me
with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.
Then I said Here I amit is written about me in the scroll I have come to do your will O God. 
First he said Sacrifices and offerings burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire nor were you pleased with them .
Then he said Here I am I have come to do your will. He sets aside the first to establish the second.
And by that will we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties again and again he offers the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.
But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand of God.
Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool
because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says
This is the covenant I will make with them after that time says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts and I will write them on their minds.
Then he adds Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.
And where these have been forgiven there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.
Therefore brothers since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus
by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain that is his body
and since we have a great priest over the house of God
let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he who promised is faithful.
And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.
Let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one anotherand all the more as you see the Day approaching.
If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth no sacrifice for sins is left
but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
For we know him who said It is mine to avenge I will repay and again The Lord will judge his people.
It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Remember those earlier days after you had received the light when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering.
Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
So do not throw away your confidence it will be richly rewarded.
You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God you will receive what he has promised.
For in just a very little while He who is coming will come and will not delay.
But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back I will not be pleased with him.
But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed but of those who believe and are saved.
Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.
This is what the ancients were commended for.
By faith we understand that the universe was formed at Gods command so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks even though he is dead.
By faith Enoch was taken from this life so that he did not experience death he could not be found because God had taken him away. For before he was taken he was commended as one who pleased God.
And without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
By faith Noah when warned about things not yet seen in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
By faith Abraham when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance obeyed and went even though he did not know where he was going.
By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country he lived in tents as did Isaac and Jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise.
For he was looking forward to the city with foundations whose architect and builder is God.
By faith Abraham even though he was past ageand Sarah herself was barrenwas enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.
And so from this one man and he as good as dead came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth.
People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
If they had been thinking of the country they had left they would have had opportunity to return.
Instead they were longing for a better countrya heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared a city for them.
By faith Abraham when God tested him offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son
even though God had said to him It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead and figuratively speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
By faith Jacob when he was dying blessed each of Josephs sons and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
By faith Joseph when his end was near spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones.
By faith Moses parents hid him for three months after he was born because they saw he was no ordinary child and they were not afraid of the kings edict.
By faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be known as the son of Pharaohs daughter.
He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time.
He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt because he was looking ahead to his reward.
By faith he left Egypt not fearing the kings anger he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.
By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
Therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
Let us fix our eyes on Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons My son do not make light of the Lords discipline and do not lose heart when he rebukes you
because the Lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.
Endure hardship as discipline God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?
If you are not disciplined  then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.
Moreover we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live!
Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best but God disciplines us for our good that we may share in his holiness.
No discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful. Later on however it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
Therefore strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.
Make level paths for your feet so that the lame may not be disabled but rather healed.
Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy without holiness no one will see the Lord.
See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
See that no one is sexually immoral or is godless like Esau who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.
Afterward as you know when he wanted to inherit this blessing he was rejected. He could bring about no change of mind though he sought the blessing with tears.
You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire to darkness gloom and storm
to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them
because they could not bear what was commanded If even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned.
The sight was so terrifying that Moses said I am trembling with fear.
But you have come to Mount Zion to the heavenly Jerusalem the city of the living God. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly
to the church of the firstborn whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God the judge of all men to the spirits of righteous men made perfect
to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
Keep on loving each other as brothers.
Do not forget to entertain strangers for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.
Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.
Marriage should be honored by all and the marriage bed kept pure for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.
Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have because God has said Never will I leave you never will I forsake you.
So we say with confidence The Lord is my helper I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
Remember your leaders who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace not by ceremonial foods which are of no value to those who eat them.
We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.
The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering but the bodies are burned outside the camp.
And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.
Let us then go to him outside the camp bearing the disgrace he bore.
For here we do not have an enduring city but we are looking for the city that is to come.
Through Jesus therefore let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praisethe fruit of lips that confess his name.
And do not forget to do good and to share with others for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy not a burden for that would be of no advantage to you.
Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.
I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.
May the God of peace who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep
equip you with everything good for doing his will and may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Brothers I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation for I have written you only a short letter.
I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon I will come with him to see you.
Greet all your leaders and all Gods people. Those from Italy send you their greetings.
Grace be with you all.
James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations Greetings.
Consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds
because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything.
If any of you lacks wisdom he should ask God who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to him.
But when he asks he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind.
That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord
he is a doubleminded man unstable in all he does.
The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position.
But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position because he will pass away like a wild flower.
For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business.
Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.
When tempted no one should say God is tempting me. For God cannot be tempted by evil nor does he tempt anyone
but each one is tempted when by his own evil desire he is dragged away and enticed.
Then after desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is fullgrown gives birth to death.
Dont be deceived my dear brothers.
Every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights who does not change like shifting shadows.
He chose to give us birth through the word of truth that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
My dear brothers take note of this Everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry
for mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.
Therefore get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you which can save you.
Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror
and after looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues to do this not forgetting what he has heard but doing ithe will be blessed in what he does.
My brothers as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ dont show favoritism.
Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.
If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say Heres a good seat for you but say to the poor man You stand there or Sit on the floor by my feet
have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
Listen my dear brothers Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?
But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?
If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture Love your neighbor as yourself you are doing right.
But if you show favoritism you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
For he who said Do not commit adultery also said Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder you have become a lawbreaker.
Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom
because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!
What good is it my brothers if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
If one of you says to him Go I wish you well keep warm and well fed but does nothing about his physical needs what good is it?
In the same way faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead.
Not many of you should presume to be teachers my brothers because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says he is a perfect man able to keep his whole body in check.
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us we can turn the whole animal.
Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
The tongue also is a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person sets the whole course of his life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell.
All kinds of animals birds reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man
but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil full of deadly poison.
With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father and with it we curse men who have been made in Gods likeness.
Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers this should not be.
Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
My brothers can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good life by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not boast about it or deny the truth.
Such wisdom does not come down from heaven but is earthly unspiritual of the devil.
For where you have envy and selfish ambition there you find disorder and every evil practice.
What causes fights and quarrels among you? Dont they come from your desires that battle within you?
You want something but dont get it. You kill and covet but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.
When you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
You adulterous people dont you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely?
But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
Submit yourselves then to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you doubleminded.
Grieve mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.
Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will lift you up.
Brothers do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law you are not keeping it but sitting in judgment on it.
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge the one who is able to save and destroy. But youwho are you to judge your neighbor?
Now listen you who say Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city spend a year there carry on business and make money.
Why you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
Instead you ought to say If it is the Lords will we will live and do this or that.
As it is you boast and brag. All such boasting is evil.
Anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesnt do it sins.
Now listen you rich people weep and wail because of the misery that is coming upon you.
Your wealth has rotted and moths have eaten your clothes.
Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
You have lived on earth in luxury and selfindulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
You have condemned and murdered innocent men who were not opposing you.
Be patient then brothers until the Lords coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains.
You too be patient and stand firm because the Lords coming is near.
Dont grumble against each other brothers or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!
Brothers as an example of patience in the face of suffering take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
As you know we consider blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Jobs perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
Above all my brothers do not swearnot by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your Yes be yes and your No no or you will be condemned.
Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise.
Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned he will be forgiven.
Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
Again he prayed and the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its crops.
My brothers if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back
remember this Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ To Gods elect strangers in the world scattered throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia
who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through the sanctifying work of the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
and into an inheritance that can never perish spoil or fadekept in heaven for you
who through faith are shielded by Gods power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
In this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
These have come so that your faithof greater worth than gold which perishes even though refined by firemay be proved genuine and may result in praise glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
Though you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy
for you are receiving the goal of your faith the salvation of your souls.
Concerning this salvation the prophets who spoke of the grace that was to come to you searched intently and with the greatest care
trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.
It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.
Therefore prepare your minds for action be selfcontrolled set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
As obedient children do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
But just as he who called you is holy so be holy in all you do
for it is written Be holy because I am holy.
Since you call on a Father who judges each mans work impartially live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.
For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers
but with the precious blood of Christ a lamb without blemish or defect.
He was chosen before the creation of the world but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
Through him you believe in God who raised him from the dead and glorified him and so your faith and hope are in God.
Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers love one another deeply from the heart.
For you have been born again not of perishable seed but of imperishable through the living and enduring word of God.
For All men are like grass and all their glory is like the flowers of the field the grass withers and the flowers fall
but the word of the Lord stands forever. And this is the word that was preached to you.
Therefore rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit hypocrisy envy and slander of every kind.
Like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk so that by it you may grow up in your salvation
now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
As you come to him the living Stonerejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him
you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
For in Scripture it says See I lay a stone in Zion a chosen and precious cornerstone and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.
Now to you who believe this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone 
and A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. They stumble because they disobey the messagewhich is also what they were destined for.
But you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to God that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
Once you were not a people but now you are the people of God once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy.
Dear friends I urge you as aliens and strangers in the world to abstain from sinful desires which war against your soul.
Live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
Submit yourselves for the Lords sake to every authority instituted among men whether to the king as the supreme authority
or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
For it is Gods will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.
Live as free men but do not use your freedom as a coverup for evil live as servants of God.
Show proper respect to everyone Love the brotherhood of believers fear God honor the king.
Slaves submit yourselves to your masters with all respect not only to those who are good and considerate but also to those who are harsh.
For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.
But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it this is commendable before God.
To this you were called because Christ suffered for you leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps.
Wives in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that if any of them do not believe the word they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives
when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
Your beauty should not come from outward adornment such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes.
Instead it should be that of your inner self the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is of great worth in Gods sight.
For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands
like Sarah who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.
Husbands in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
Finally all of you live in harmony with one another be sympathetic love as brothers be compassionate and humble.
Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult but with blessing because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
For Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech.
He must turn from evil and do good he must seek peace and pursue it.
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
But even if you should suffer for what is right you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear  do not be frightened.
But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect
keeping a clear conscience so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.
It is better if it is Gods will to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
For Christ died for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit
Therefore since Christ suffered in his body arm yourselves also with the same attitude because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.
As a result he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires but rather for the will of God.
For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to doliving in debauchery lust drunkenness orgies carousing and detestable idolatry.
They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation and they heap abuse on you.
But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body but live according to God in regard to the spirit.
The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and selfcontrolled so that you can pray.
Above all love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins.
Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering Gods grace in its various forms.
If anyone speaks he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves he should do it with the strength God provides so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
Dear friends do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering as though something strange were happening to you.
But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
To the elders among you I appeal as a fellow elder a witness of Christs sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed
Be shepherds of Gods flock that is under your care serving as overseersnot because you must but because you are willing as God wants you to be not greedy for money but eager to serve
not lording it over those entrusted to you but being examples to the flock.
And when the Chief Shepherd appears you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
Young men in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another because God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
Humble yourselves therefore under Gods mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time.
Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
Be selfcontrolled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
Resist him standing firm in the faith because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
And the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ after you have suffered a little while will himself restore you and make you strong firm and steadfast.
To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
With the help of Silas whom I regard as a faithful brother I have written to you briefly encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.
She who is in Babylon chosen together with you sends you her greetings and so does my son Mark.
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
Simon Peter a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours
Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.
Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
For this very reason make every effort to add to your faith goodness and to goodness knowledge
and to knowledge selfcontrol and to selfcontrol perseverance and to perseverance godliness
and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love.
For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But if anyone does not have them he is nearsighted and blind and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.
Therefore my brothers be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things you will never fall
and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
So I will always remind you of these things even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.
I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body
because I know that I will soon put it aside as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.
We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory saying This is my Son whom I love with him I am well pleased.
We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.
And we have the word of the prophets made more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
Above all you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophets own interpretation.
For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
But there were also false prophets among the people just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies even denying the sovereign Lord who bought thembringing swift destruction on themselves.
Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.
In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them and their destruction has not been sleeping.
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned but sent them to hell putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment
if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people but protected Noah a preacher of righteousness and seven others
if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly
and if he rescued Lot a righteous man who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men

if this is so then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment while continuing their punishment.
This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority. Bold and arrogant these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings
yet even angels although they are stronger and more powerful do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord.
But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts creatures of instinct born only to be caught and destroyed and like beasts they too will perish.
They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.
With eyes full of adultery they never stop sinning they seduce the unstable they are experts in greedan accursed brood!
They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor who loved the wages of wickedness.
But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkeya beast without speechwho spoke with a mans voice and restrained the prophets madness.
These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
Dear friends this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.
I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
First of all you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and following their own evil desires.
They will say Where is this coming he promised? Ever since our fathers died everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.
But they deliberately forget that long ago by Gods word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
But do not forget this one thing dear friends With the Lord a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day.
The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness. He is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.
That which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked at and our hands have touchedthis we proclaim concerning the Word of life.
The life appeared we have seen it and testify to it and we proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and has appeared to us.
We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
We write this to make our joy complete.
This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you God is light in him there is no darkness at all.
If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not live by the truth.
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son purifies us from all sin.
If we claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
If we claim we have not sinned we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives.
My dear children I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin we have one who speaks to the Father in our defenseJesus Christ the Righteous One.
He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands.
The man who says I know him but does not do what he commands is a liar and the truth is not in him.
But if anyone obeys his word Gods love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him
Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.
Dear friends I am not writing you a new command but an old one which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard.
Yet I am writing you a new command its truth is seen in him and you because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness.
Whoever loves his brother lives in the light and there is nothing in him to make him stumble.
But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness he does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded him.
I write to you dear children because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
I write to you fathers because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you young men because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you dear children because you have known the Father.
I write to you fathers because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you young men because you are strong and the word of God lives in you and you have overcome the evil one.
Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world the love of the Father is not in him.
For everything in the worldthe cravings of sinful man the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and doescomes not from the Father but from the world.
The world and its desires pass away but the man who does the will of God lives forever.
Dear children this is the last hour and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.
They went out from us but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.
But you have an anointing from the Holy One and all of you know the truth.
I do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth.
Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichristhe denies the Father and the Son.
No one who denies the Son has the Father whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
How great is the love the Father has lavished on us that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
Dear friends now we are children of God and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is.
Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure.
Everyone who sins breaks the law in fact sin is lawlessness.
But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.
No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
Dear children do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous.
He who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devils work.
No one who is born of God will continue to sin because Gods seed remains in him he cannot go on sinning because he has been born of God.
This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God nor is anyone who does not love his brother.
This is the message you heard from the beginning We should love one another.
Do not be like Cain who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brothers were righteous.
Do not be surprised my brothers if the world hates you.
We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death.
Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.
This is how we know what love is Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him how can the love of God be in him?
Dear children let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.
This then is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence
whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything.
Dear friends do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God
but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.
You dear children are from God and have overcome them because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world and the world listens to them.
We are from God and whoever knows God listens to us but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.
Dear friends let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
Whoever does not love does not know God because God is love.
This is how God showed his love among us He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
This is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
Dear friends since God so loved us we also ought to love one another.
No one has ever seen God but if we love one another God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.
We know that we live in him and he in us because he has given us of his Spirit.
And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God God lives in him and he in God.
And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God and God in him.
In this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment because in this world we are like him.
There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
We love because he first loved us.
If anyone says I love God yet hates his brother he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
And he has given us this command Whoever loves God must also love his brother.
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.
This is how we know that we love the children of God by loving God and carrying out his commands.
This is love for God to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome
for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world even our faith.
Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
This is the one who came by water and bloodJesus Christ. He did not come by water only but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies because the Spirit is the truth.
For there are three that testify
the Spirit the water and the blood and the three are in agreement.
We accept mans testimony but Gods testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God which he has given about his Son.
Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar because he has not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.
And this is the testimony God has given us eternal life and this life is in his Son.
He who has the Son has life he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
The elder To the chosen lady and her children whom I love in the truthand not I only but also all who know the truth
because of the truth which lives in us and will be with us forever
Grace mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Fathers Son will be with us in truth and love.
It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth just as the Father commanded us.
And now dear lady I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.
And this is love that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning his command is that you walk in love.
Many deceivers who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for but that you may be rewarded fully.
Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not take him into your house or welcome him.
Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.
I have much to write to you but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face so that our joy may be complete.
The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.
The elder To my dear friend Gaius whom I love in the truth.
Dear friend I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you even as your soul is getting along well.
It gave me great joy to have some brothers come and tell about your faithfulness to the truth and how you continue to walk in the truth.
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
Dear friend you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers even though they are strangers to you.
They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
It was for the sake of the Name that they went out receiving no help from the pagans.
We ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth.
I wrote to the church but Diotrephes who loves to be first will have nothing to do with us.
So if I come I will call attention to what he is doing gossiping maliciously about us. Not satisfied with that he refuses to welcome the brothers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.
Dear friend do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
Demetrius is well spoken of by everyoneand even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him and you know that our testimony is true.
I have much to write you but I do not want to do so with pen and ink.
I hope to see you soon and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.
Jude a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James To those who have been called who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ
Mercy peace and love be yours in abundance.
Dear friends although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.
Though you already know all this I want to remind you that the Lord delivered his people out of Egypt but later destroyed those who did not believe.
And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own homethese he has kept in darkness bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.
In a similar way Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
In the very same way these dreamers pollute their own bodies reject authority and slander celestial beings.
But even the archangel Michael when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him but said The Lord rebuke you!
Yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand and what things they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animalsthese are the very things that destroy them.
Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain they have rushed for profit into Balaams error they have been destroyed in Korahs rebellion.
These men are blemishes at your love feasts eating with you without the slightest qualmshepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain blown along by the wind autumn trees without fruit and uprootedtwice dead.
They are wild waves of the sea foaming up their shame wandering stars for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied about these men See the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones
to judge everyone and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
These men are grumblers and faultfinders they follow their own evil desires they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
But dear friends remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
They said to you In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.
These are the men who divide you who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John
who testifies to everything he sawthat is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it because the time is near.
John To the seven churches in the province of Asia Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits before his throne
and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood
and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Fatherto him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
Look he is coming with the clouds and every eye will see him even those who pierced him and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen.
I am the Alpha and the Omega says the Lord God who is and who was and who is to come the Almighty.
I John your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
On the Lords Day I was in the Spirit and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
which said Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches to Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea.
I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands
and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.
His head and hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were like blazing fire.
His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
In his right hand he held seven stars and out of his mouth came a sharp doubleedged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
When I saw him I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.
I am the Living One I was dead and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
Write therefore what you have seen what is now and what will take place later.
The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
To the angel of the church in Ephesus write These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands
I know your deeds your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them false.
You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name and have not grown weary.
Yet I hold this against you You have forsaken your first love.
Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
But you have this in your favor You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans which I also hate.
He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give the right to eat from the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.
To the angel of the church in Smyrna write These are the words of him who is the First and the Last who died and came to life again.
I know your afflictions and your povertyyet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not but are a synagogue of Satan.
Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you the devil will put some of you in prison to test you and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful even to the point of death and I will give you the crown of life.
He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death.
To the angel of the church in Pergamum write These are the words of him who has the sharp doubleedged sword.
I know where you livewhere Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness who was put to death in your citywhere Satan lives.
Nevertheless I have a few things against you You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.
Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
Repent therefore! Otherwise I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it known only to him who receives it.
To the angel of the church in Thyatira write These are the words of the Son of God whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.
I know your deeds your love and faith your service and perseverance and that you are now doing more than you did at first.
Nevertheless I have this against you You tolerate that woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
I have given her time to repent of her immorality but she is unwilling.
To the angel of the church in Sardis write These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds you have a reputation of being alive but you are dead.
Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die for I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God.
Remember therefore what you have received and heard obey it and repent. But if you do not wake up I will come like a thief and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me dressed in white for they are worthy.
He who overcomes will like them be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels.
He who has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write These are the words of him who is holy and true who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut and what he shuts no one can open.
I know your deeds. See I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan who claim to be Jews though they are not but are liarsI will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.
Since you have kept my command to endure patiently I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.
After this I looked and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said Come up here and I will show you what must take place after this.
At once I was in the Spirit and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.
And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow resembling an emerald encircled the throne.
Surrounding the throne were twentyfour other thrones and seated on them were twentyfour elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.
From the throne came flashes of lightning rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of God.
Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass clear as crystal. In the center around the throne were four living creatures and they were covered with eyes in front and in back.
The first living creature was like a lion the second was like an ox the third had a face like a man the fourth was like a flying eagle.
Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying Holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
Whenever the living creatures give glory honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever
the twentyfour elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say
You are worthy our Lord and God to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they were created and have their being.
Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals.
And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?
But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.
I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.
Then one of the elders said to me Do not weep! See the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root of David has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.
Then I saw a Lamb looking as if it had been slain standing in the center of the throne encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
He came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
And when he had taken it the four living creatures and the twentyfour elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints.
And they sang a new song You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were slain and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God and they will reign on the earth.
Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels numbering thousands upon thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
In a loud voice they sang Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!
Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all that is in them singing To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power for ever and ever!
The four living creatures said Amen and the elders fell down and worshiped.
I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder Come!
I looked and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow and he was given a crown and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
When the Lamb opened the second seal I heard the second living creature say Come!
Then another horse came out a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.
When the Lamb opened the third seal I heard the third living creature say Come! I looked and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.
Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures saying A quart of wheat for a days wages and three quarts of barley for a days wages and do not damage the oil and the wine!
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say Come!
I looked and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword famine and plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.
When he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.
They called out in a loud voice How long Sovereign Lord holy and true until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?
Then each of them was given a white robe and they were told to wait a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.
I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair the whole moon turned blood red
and the stars in the sky fell to earth as late figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.
The sky receded like a scroll rolling up and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
Then the kings of the earth the princes the generals the rich the mighty and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
They called to the mountains and the rocks Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!
For the great day of their wrath has come and who can stand?
After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.
Then I saw another angel coming up from the east having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea
Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.
Then I heard the number of those who were sealed 144000 from all the tribes of Israel.
From the tribe of Judah 12000 were sealed from the tribe of Reuben 12000 from the tribe of Gad 12000
from the tribe of Asher 12000 from the tribe of Naphtali 12000 from the tribe of Manasseh 12000
from the tribe of Simeon 12000 from the tribe of Levi 12000 from the tribe of Issachar 12000
from the tribe of Zebulun 12000 from the tribe of Joseph 12000 from the tribe of Benjamin 12000.
After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation tribe people and language standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.
And they cried out in a loud voice Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.
All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God
saying Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!
When he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and to them were given seven trumpets.
Another angel who had a golden censer came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.
The smoke of the incense together with the prayers of the saints went up before God from the angels hand.
Then the angel took the censer filled it with fire from the altar and hurled it on the earth and there came peals of thunder rumblings flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
The first angel sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up a third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up.
The second angel sounded his trumpet and something like a huge mountain all ablaze was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood
a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed.
The third angel sounded his trumpet and a great star blazing like a torch fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water
the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light and also a third of the night.
As I watched I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!
The fifth angel sounded his trumpet and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.
They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
They were not given power to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man.
During those days men will seek death but will not find it they will long to die but death will elude them.
The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold and their faces resembled human faces.
Their hair was like womens hair and their teeth were like lions teeth.
They had breastplates like breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.
They had tails and stings like scorpions and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months.
Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud with a rainbow above his head his face was like the sun and his legs were like fiery pillars.
He was holding a little scroll which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land
and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted the voices of the seven thunders spoke.
And when the seven thunders spoke I was about to write but I heard a voice from heaven say Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.
Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever who created the heavens and all that is in them the earth and all that is in it and the sea and all that is in it and said There will be no more delay!
But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet the mystery of God will be accomplished just as he announced to his servants the prophets.
Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more Go take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.
So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.
I took the little scroll from the angels hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth but when I had eaten it my stomach turned sour.
Then I was told You must prophesy again about many peoples nations languages and kings.
I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told Go and measure the temple of God and the altar and count the worshipers there.
But exclude the outer court do not measure it because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.
And I will give power to my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1260 days clothed in sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
If anyone tries to harm them fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.
These men have power to shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
Now when they have finished their testimony the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them and overpower and kill them.
Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt where also their Lord was crucified.
For three and a half days men from every people tribe language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial.
The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.
But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them and they stood on their feet and terror struck those who saw them.
Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them Come up here. And they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies looked on.
At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second woe has passed the third woe is coming soon.
The seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven which said The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he will reign for ever and ever.
And the twentyfour elders who were seated on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God
saying We give thanks to you Lord God Almighty the One who is and who was because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign.
A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
Then another sign appeared in heaven an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.
His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that he might devour her child the moment it was born.
She gave birth to a son a male child who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.
The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God where she might be taken care of for 1260 days.
And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought back.
But he was not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven.
The great dragon was hurled downthat ancient serpent called the devil or Satan who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth and his angels with him.
Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers who accuses them before our God day and night has been hurled down.
They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
Therefore rejoice you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury because he knows that his time is short.
When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert where she would be taken care of for a time times and half a time out of the serpents reach.
Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.
But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspringthose who obey Gods commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.
And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads with ten crowns on his horns and on each head a blasphemous name.
The beast I saw resembled a leopard but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.
One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast.
Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast and they also worshiped the beast and asked Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?
The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for fortytwo months.
He opened his mouth to blaspheme God and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.
He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe people language and nation.
All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beastall whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world.
He who has an ear let him hear.
If anyone is to go into captivity into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword with the sword he will be killed. This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints.
Then I saw another beast coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb but he spoke like a dragon.
He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose fatal wound had been healed.
And he performed great and miraculous signs even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men.
Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.
He also forced everyone small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead
so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight let him calculate the number of the beast for it is mans number. His number is 666.
Then I looked and there before me was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion and with him 144000 who had his name and his Fathers name written on their foreheads.
And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.
And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
These are those who did not defile themselves with women for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.
No lie was found in their mouths they are blameless.
Then I saw another angel flying in midair and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earthto every nation tribe language and people.
He said in a loud voice Fear God and give him glory because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens the earth the sea and the springs of water.
I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign seven angels with the seven last plagueslast because with them Gods wrath is completed.
And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and standing beside the sea those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name. They held harps given them by God
and sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb Great and marvelous are your deeds Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways King of the ages.
Who will not fear you O Lord and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you for your righteous acts have been revealed.
After this I looked and in heaven the temple that is the tabernacle of the Testimony was opened.
Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.
Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels Go pour out the seven bowls of Gods wrath on the earth.
The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image.
The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it turned into blood like that of a dead man and every living thing in the sea died.
The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water and they became blood.
Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say You are just in these judgments you who are and who were the Holy One because you have so judged
for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.
And I heard the altar respond Yes Lord God Almighty true and just are your judgments.
The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire.
They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God who had control over these plagues but they refused to repent and glorify him.
The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. Men gnawed their tongues in agony
and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores but they refused to repent of what they had done.
The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.
Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs they came out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs and they go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
Behold I come like a thief! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed.
Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne saying It is done!
One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me Come I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters.
With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.
Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.
The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.
This title was written on her forehead MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her I was greatly astonished.
Then the angel said to me Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides which has the seven heads and ten horns.
The beast which you saw once was now is not and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast because he once was now is not and yet will come.
This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.
They are also seven kings. Five have fallen one is the other has not yet come but when he does come he must remain for a little while.
The beast who once was and now is not is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.
The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.
They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.
They will make war against the Lamb but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kingsand with him will be his called chosen and faithful followers.
Then the angel said to me The waters you saw where the prostitute sits are peoples multitudes nations and languages.
The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule until Gods words are fulfilled.
The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.
After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
With a mighty voice he shouted Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird.
For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.
Then I heard another voice from heaven say Come out of her my people so that you will not share in her sins so that you will not receive any of her plagues
Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts I sit as queen I am not a widow and I will never mourn.
Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her death mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.
When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning they will weep and mourn over her.
Terrified at her torment they will stand far off and cry  Woe! Woe O great city O Babylon city of power! In one hour your doom has come!
The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more
cargoes of gold silver precious stones and pearls fine linen purple silk and scarlet cloth every sort of citron wood and articles of every kind made of ivory costly wood bronze iron and marble
cargoes of cinnamon and spice of incense myrrh and frankincense of wine and olive oil of fine flour and wheat cattle and sheep horses and carriages and bodies and souls of men.
They will say The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished never to be recovered.
The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn
and cry out  Woe! Woe O great city dressed in fine linen purple and scarlet and glittering with gold precious stones and pearls!
In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin! Every sea captain and all who travel by ship the sailors and all who earn their living from the sea will stand far off.
When they see the smoke of her burning they will exclaim Was there ever a city like this great city?
They will throw dust on their heads and with weeping and mourning cry out  Woe! Woe O great city where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!
Rejoice over her O heaven! Rejoice saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you. 
After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God
for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.
And again they shouted Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.
The twentyfour elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne. And they cried Amen Hallelujah!
Then a voice came from the throne saying Praise our God all you his servants you who fear him both small and great!
Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder shouting Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns.
Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready.
Fine linen bright and clean was given her to wear.
Then the angel said to me Write Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!  And he added These are the true words of God.
At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and makes war.
His eyes are like blazing fire and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.
He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood and his name is the Word of God.
The armies of heaven were following him riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen white and clean.
And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.
He seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil or Satan and bound him for a thousand years.
He threw him into the Abyss and locked and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be set free for a short time.
I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
When the thousand years are over Satan will be released from his prison
and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earthGog and Magogto gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of Gods people the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence and there was no place for them.
And I saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened. Another book was opened which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
The sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them and each person was judged according to what he had done.
Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.
If anyones name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire.
Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and there was no longer any sea.
I saw the Holy City the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying Now the dwelling of God is with men and he will live with them. They will be his people and God himself will be with them and be their God.
He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away.
He who was seated on the throne said I am making everything new! Then he said Write this down for these words are trustworthy and true.
He said to me It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.
He who overcomes will inherit all this and I will be his God and he will be my son.
But the cowardly the unbelieving the vile the murderers the sexually immoral those who practice magic arts the idolaters and all liarstheir place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.
One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me Come I will show you the bride the wife of the Lamb.
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high and showed me the Holy City Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.
It shone with the glory of God and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel like a jasper clear as crystal.
It had a great high wall with twelve gates and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
There were three gates on the east three on the north three on the south and three on the west.
The wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city its gates and its walls.
The city was laid out like a square as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12000 stadia in length and as wide and high as it is long.
He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits thick by mans measurement which the angel was using.
The wall was made of jasper and the city of pure gold as pure as glass.
The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald
the fifth sardonyx the sixth carnelian the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth and the twelfth amethyst.
Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life as clear as crystal flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life bearing twelve crops of fruit yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city and his servants will serve him.
They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads.
I John am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me.
But he said to me Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!
Then he told me Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book because the time is near.
Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong let him who is vile continue to be vile let him who does right continue to do right and let him who is holy continue to be holy.
Behold I am coming soon! My reward is with me and I will give to everyone according to what he has done.
I am the Alpha and the Omega the First and the Last the Beginning and the End.
Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.
Outside are the dogs those who practice magic arts the sexually immoral the murderers the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
I Jesus have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David and the bright Morning Star.
The Spirit and the bride say Come! And let him who hears say Come! Whoever is thirsty let him come and whoever wishes let him take the free gift of the water of life.
I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book If anyone adds anything to them God will add to him the plagues described in this book.
And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city which are described in this book.
He who testifies to these things says Yes I am coming soon. Amen. Come Lord Jesus.
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with Gods people. Amen.
